    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"our country 's a mess\nit 's one thing to have $ 20 trillion in debt\nOur airports are like from a third world country\nYou land at LaGuardia , you land at Kennedy , you land at LAX , you land at Newark , and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible—you come in from China , you see these incredible airports\nwe 've become a third world country\nour bridges are good\neverything 's in great shape\nour airports\nthe worst of all things has happened\nWe owe $ 20 trillion\nwe 're a mess\nWe have n't even started\nwe 've spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East\naccording to a report that I just saw\nWhether it 's 6 or 5\n it looks like it 's 6\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice\nit 's really a shame\nit 's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem\nOur country has tremendous problems\nWe 're a debtor nation\nWe 're a serious debtor nation\nwe have a country that needs new roads , new tunnels , new bridges , new airports , new schools , new hospitals\nwe don't have the money\nit 's been squandered on so many of your ideas\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated?

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented.

Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content.

Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible?

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"there are a number of issues that we should be addressing\nI have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS\nIt does involve going after them online\nwe need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize , even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere\neventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa\nend their claim of being a Caliphate\nWe 're making progress\nOur military is assisting in Iraq\nwe 're hoping that within the year we 'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq\nreally squeeze them in Syria\nwe have to be cognizant of the fact that they 've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them\nforeign money\nforeign weapons\nwe have to make this the top priority\nI would also do everything possible to take out their leadership\nI was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state\nincluding , of course , taking out bin Laden\nwe need to go after Baghdadi , as well\nmake that one of our organizing principles\nwe 've got to defeat ISIS\nwe 've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible?

My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.\nI am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.\nIf I eat a peanut I'll get sick.\nI ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.\nIt was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.\nI would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.\nEverybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.\"\"",

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"Doctor-Mom: \"I would support a full ban of peanut products on any airline.\nPeanut reactions can be life threatening.\nAn individual doesn't have to consume the product to have a life threatening reaction.\nThey can have contact or inhalation reactions.\nRestricting to certain flights is not enough,\nas residue can be rampant.\nProviding buffer zones is a thoughtful gesture,\nbut from a practical point of view does not work.\nWith so many food choices available, why are peanuts a necessary choice?\nI am a physician , and author on the subject.\nI have free food allergy online support forums with 3000 members.\nhttp://www.drmomsallergyrx.com/\nI would be more than willing to work with you in any way on this decision making process.\nThe allergic community is so grateful that you are allowing our voices to be heard.\nThe decision you are considering could save many lives.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"17th: \"They should get the coverage\nThey are here\nthey work\nthey are a part of this society\nFuck off with your xenophobia\"\n < this message is answering to > \nreaper527: \"now you have a field of democrat presidential candidates supporting it\nrepublicans used to get mocked and laughed at when they said that illegal immigrants would be getting obamacare coverage\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"If you help create the profits , you should be able to share in them , not just the executives at the top\nI want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work\nI 've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you 're under\nlet 's have paid family leave , earned sick days\nLet 's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college\nHow are we going to do it\nWe 're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes\nwe tonight are on the stage together , Donald Trump and I\nit 's good to be with you\nWe 're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country\nYou have to judge us , who can shoulder the immense , awesome responsibilities of the presidency , who can put into action the plans that will make your life better\nI hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.
