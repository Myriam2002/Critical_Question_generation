During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers.

Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

What is the evidence that the form of capitalism mentioned was not generating sufficient surpluses, and is this a universally accepted fact?\n2. Is the assumption that the money flow is solely driven by the pursuit of higher profits a valid one, and are there other factors at play?\n3. How does the speaker define \"sufficient surpluses,\" and is this a subjective or objective measure?\n4. What is the causal link between the lack of surpluses in industrial activities and the flow of money into other areas, and is this link explicitly stated?\n5. Does the speaker's argument rely on a zero-sum game assumption, where the flow of money into one area necessarily means it is not flowing into another?\n6.

USEFUL: This question highlights the potential oversimplification of the speaker's argument, which assumes that the pursuit of higher profits is the sole driver of money flow. By asking about other factors at play, this question encourages a more nuanced understanding of the issue.\n\n3. USEFUL: This question targets the ambiguity of the term \"sufficient surpluses\" and asks for clarification on whether this is a subjective or objective measure. This is important, as the speaker's argument relies on this concept, and a clear understanding of its meaning is necessary to evaluate the argument's validity.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question seeks to understand the causal link between the lack of surpluses in industrial activities and the flow of money into other areas. By asking whether this link is explicitly stated, this question encourages the speaker to provide a clear explanation of their argument's logic.\n\n5. USEFUL: This question challenges the speaker's potential assumption of a zero-sum game, where the flow of money into one area necessarily means it is not flowing into another. By questioning this assumption, this question promotes a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between different economic activities.\n\n6. UNHELPFUL: While this question is related to the text, it is primarily a factual question that can be answered by verifying historical data.

What specific evidence supports the claim that the form of capitalism mentioned was not generating sufficient surpluses, and how does this evidence account for potential variations across different industries and regions?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question targets the same assumption as the original but requests more specific evidence and consideration of potential variations, making it a more nuanced and challenging inquiry.\n\n**Rank 2:**\n2. To what extent does the pursuit of higher profits drive the flow of money, and what other factors, such as regulatory environments, technological advancements, or social and environmental considerations, might influence this flow?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question maintains the original's focus on challenging the assumption of a single driver of money flow but expands the scope to consider a broader range of factors, encouraging a more comprehensive analysis.\n\n**Rank 3:**\n3. How does the speaker define and measure \"sufficient surpluses,\" and what are the implications of using this metric to evaluate the performance of different economic activities?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question retains the original's focus on clarifying the ambiguous term but adds a request to explore the implications of using this metric, making it a more thought-provoking inquiry.\n\n**Rank 4:**\n4. Can you elaborate on the causal link between the lack of surpluses in industrial activities and the flow of money into other areas, and what are the potential risks or unintended consequences of this flow?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question builds on the original by requesting a clearer explanation of the causal link and adds an exploration of potential risks or unintended consequences, making it a more comprehensive and critical inquiry.\n\n**Rank 5:**\n5. In what ways might the assumption of a zero-sum game, where the flow of money into one area necessarily means it is not flowing into another, oversimplify the complex relationships between different economic activities, and what alternative perspectives might offer a more nuanced understanding?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question maintains the original's challenge to the zero-sum game assumption but expands the scope to consider alternative perspectives, encouraging a more nuanced and multifaceted analysis.\n\n**Rank 6:**\n6. (Removed, as the original question was classified as UNHELPFUL)\n\nI replaced the original question 6 with a new one that is more open-ended and meaningful for critical analysis:\n\n**New question 6:**\n6. What potential alternative forms of capitalism or economic systems might address the issue of insufficient surpluses, and what are the potential benefits and drawbacks of these alternatives?\n\n**Improvement:** This new question encourages the exploration of alternative perspectives and solutions, making it a more thought-provoking and critically oriented inquiry.\n\nThe revised list of improved questions is designed to be more effective at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, and proposing alternative perspectives, while avoiding vague, obvious, or out-of-scope questions.",

I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\ncd38: \"The return flight is 6 ½ hours (plus commute time to the airport);\nwhen time allows, I make something to bring on the flight,\nbut if my mother is having a bad day, that's not always possible.\nOn a recent trip, I didn't have time to eat anything at all the day I flew home; got stuck in traffic and barely made my flight (I was the last one on) so didn't have time to eat or buy anything at the airport; and as we started to taxi, the flight crew announced that we had a nut allergy on board, and that they (JB) would not be serving cashews and requested that we not eat any nuts we may have brought on board.\n6 ½ hours feels pretty long at that point!\nNo, it didn't kill me,\nbut it does seem that if JB hadn't served cashews, the risks involved in one or two people eating nuts they may have brought with them would have been extremely, extremely small....\nand, NOTHING in life is riskfree.\nI understand that people want to minimize the risks for their loved ones,\nbut you cannot eliminate the risk completely, regardless of what legislation you put in place.\nIf I ate peanuts at the airport, didn't wash my hands, and then opened the rest room door on the plane immediately before a peanut allergy sufferer, that person could suffer a reaction.\nI can support airlines not serving peanuts/peanut products,\nthereby eliminating the most likely possible cause of a peanutrelated incident on a flight;\nbut not restrictions on what people may choose to eat.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the assumption that the risk of an allergic reaction from a passenger eating nuts they brought on board is extremely small supported by any evidence or expert opinion?\n2. Does the author's personal experience of surviving a 6 ½ hour flight without eating support their argument against restrictions on what people may choose to eat on flights?\n3. Is the comparison between eating peanuts at the airport and not washing hands before opening the restroom door on the plane a valid analogy for the risks associated with eating nuts on a flight?\n4. Does the author's concession that airlines should not serve peanuts/peanut products undermine their argument against restrictions on what people may choose to eat on flights?\n5. Is the assertion that \"NOTHING in life is risk-free\" a sufficient justification for not taking steps to minimize the risks associated with peanut allergies on flights?\n6.

USEFUL: This question challenges the author's assumption about the risk of an allergic reaction from a passenger eating nuts they brought on board. It requires evidence or expert opinion to support or refute the author's claim, making it a useful question for critical analysis.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL: The author's personal experience of surviving a 6 ½ hour flight without eating is not directly relevant to the argument against restrictions on what people may choose to eat on flights. While it may provide some anecdotal evidence, it is not a strong basis for the author's argument, and the answer to this question is unlikely to significantly impact the validity of the argument.\n\n3. USEFUL: This question challenges the author's analogy between eating peanuts at the airport and not washing hands before opening the restroom door on the plane. It requires an evaluation of the validity of this comparison and whether it accurately represents the risks associated with eating nuts on a flight.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question highlights a potential inconsistency in the author's argument. By conceding that airlines should not serve peanuts/peanut products, the author may be undermining their own argument against restrictions on what people may choose to eat on flights. This question requires an analysis of the author's argument and its internal consistency.\n\n5.

It requires an evaluation of the author's risk assessment and whether it is a valid basis for their argument.\n\n6. USEFUL: This question requires an analysis of the author's argument and its consideration of the potential consequences of an allergic reaction on a flight. It challenges the author's focus on the perceived likelihood of such an event and asks whether they have adequately accounted for the potential consequences, making it a useful question for critical analysis.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Carefully analyze each question's strengths and weaknesses based on the intervention and LLM feedback.\n2. Revise each question to be clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives.\n3. Avoid vague, obvious, or out-of-scope questions.\n4. Integrate the evaluator's feedback carefully for improvements.\n\nFinally:\n- Return a list of improved questions, ranked from strongest to weakest based on quality and depth.\n- Make sure the questions are open-ended and meaningful for critical analysis.",

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content.

What is the relevance of the endorsements from admirals, generals, ICE, and Border Patrol agents to Trump’s qualifications for leading the country, and do these endorsements necessarily translate to effective leadership?\n2. How does Trump’s dismissal of \"political hacks\" address the actual criticisms or policy proposals made by Secretary Clinton, and does this dismissal constitute a valid counterargument?\n3. Is Trump’s claim that the country is in a \"mess\" a sufficient justification for his candidacy, and what specific policies or actions does he propose to address this perceived mess?\n4. What is the basis for Trump’s skepticism about Russia’s involvement in the DNC hack, and does his uncertainty on this issue undermine his ability to address cybersecurity concerns?\n5. Does Trump’s agreement with \"parts of what Secretary Clinton said\" on cybersecurity indicate a willingness to engage in bipartisan cooperation, or is this statement an attempt to deflect criticism?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"AngelComa: \"Funny, I thought he did good\nThey get timed responses\nhis plan is all there\nHe can't talk about everything in the plan\nMust be how used you are to politicians saying things and not having a plan\"\n < this message is answering to > \nPunchee: \"That was a weird moment in American debate history. \"Yo check my website.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

The fact that politicians often make promises without a plan is not relevant to whether AngelComa's argument is credible.\n\n3. UNHELPFUL: This question is related to the text, but the answer is likely to be common sense (it's not reasonable to expect a politician to discuss every aspect of their plan during a timed debate). This question doesn't generate controversy or challenge the argument in a significant way.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question challenges the assumption that the existence of a plan on a website is a sufficient substitute for a clear and concise explanation during a debate, which is a key aspect of AngelComa's argument.\n\n5.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated?

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nTRUMP: \"our country 's a mess\nit 's one thing to have $ 20 trillion in debt\nOur airports are like from a third world country\nYou land at LaGuardia , you land at Kennedy , you land at LAX , you land at Newark , and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible—you come in from China , you see these incredible airports\nwe 've become a third world country\nour bridges are good\neverything 's in great shape\nour airports\nthe worst of all things has happened\nWe owe $ 20 trillion\nwe 're a mess\nWe have n't even started\nwe 've spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East\naccording to a report that I just saw\nWhether it 's 6 or 5\n it looks like it 's 6\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice\nit 's really a shame\nit 's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem\nOur country has tremendous problems\nWe 're a debtor nation\nWe 're a serious debtor nation\nwe have a country that needs new roads , new tunnels , new bridges , new airports , new schools , new hospitals\nwe don't have the money\nit 's been squandered on so many of your ideas\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the comparison between US airports and those in Dubai, Qatar, and China a fair and relevant measure of a country's overall economic health?\n2. Does the mention of a specific report stating $6 trillion spent in the Middle East add credibility to Trump's argument, and is this figure verifiable?\n3. How does Trump's claim that the country could have been rebuilt twice with the $6 trillion spent in the Middle East account for the complexities of infrastructure development and the allocation of funds?\n4. Is Trump's assertion that politicians like Secretary Clinton are solely responsible for the country's debt and infrastructure problems an oversimplification of the issues?\n5. Does Trump's focus on the country's debt and infrastructure problems overlook other important factors that contribute to a country's overall well-being and prosperity?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"citizen-s: \"DOT's objective in setting this rule should be to ELIMINATE all bumping, not merely achieve some (unspecified) reduction.\nRegardless of how many caveats an airline might state in its contract terms, passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat.\nBumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity, like so many other aspects of airline behavior.\nFrom that objective, it follows that there should be NO cap on compensation\nand that the financial penalty to the airline should be strong enough to prevent bumping, not just keep it at some arbitrarily \"acceptable\" level.\nThe 100% of the total ticket price for expected arrival within 2 hours later is reasonable.\nCompensation for a longer delay should be the GREATER of 200% of the total ticket cost or the passenger's demonstrable outofpocket costs resulting from the delay\n(a) including any higher priced air ticket from the same or another carrier at the same class, and lodging, meals and incidentals at average prevailing prices in that metro area,\nand (b) with the obligation on the passenger to minimize those costs by arranging, with good faith help from the airline, an alternate flight or other means to get him or her to the destination as soon as reasonably practical.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\ncitizen-s: \"DOT's objective in setting this rule should be to ELIMINATE all bumping, not merely achieve some (unspecified) reduction.\nRegardless of how many caveats an airline might state in its contract terms, passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat.\nBumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity, like so many other aspects of airline behavior.\nFrom that objective, it follows that there should be NO cap on compensation\nand that the financial penalty to the airline should be strong enough to prevent bumping, not just keep it at some arbitrarily \"acceptable\" level.\nThe 100% of the total ticket price for expected arrival within 2 hours later is reasonable.\nCompensation for a longer delay should be the GREATER of 200% of the total ticket cost or the passenger's demonstrable outofpocket costs resulting from the delay\n(a) including any higher priced air ticket from the same or another carrier at the same class, and lodging, meals and incidentals at average prevailing prices in that metro area,\nand (b) with the obligation on the passenger to minimize those costs by arranging, with good faith help from the airline, an alternate flight or other means to get him or her to the destination as soon as reasonably practical.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the assumption that bumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity an oversimplification of the complexities of airline operations?\n2. Does the text provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat, or is this an unsubstantiated assertion?\n3. How does the author justify the specific compensation amounts proposed, such as 100% of the total ticket price for a 2-hour delay, and are these amounts arbitrary or based on empirical data?\n4. Is the proposal for compensation based on the greater of 200% of the total ticket cost or the passenger's demonstrable out-of-pocket costs a fair and reasonable approach, or does it create unintended consequences?\n5. Does the text adequately address potential counterarguments, such as the possibility that airlines may pass on increased compensation costs to consumers through higher ticket prices?\n6. Is the obligation on the passenger to minimize costs by arranging an alternate flight or other means to get to the destination as soon as reasonably practical a realistic and fair expectation, or does it place undue burden on the passenger?\n\nANSWER:",

USEFUL: This question challenges the assumption that bumping is a purely economic device, which is a crucial aspect of the argument. By questioning this assumption, it encourages critical thinking about the complexities of airline operations and whether the author's characterization is accurate.\n\n2. USEFUL: This question highlights the need for evidence to support the claim that passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat. It prompts the reader to consider whether this assertion is substantiated or simply a rhetorical device.\n\n3. USEFUL: This question scrutinizes the specific compensation amounts proposed and asks whether they are arbitrary or based on empirical data. It encourages the reader to think critically about the justification for these amounts and whether they are reasonable.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question evaluates the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed compensation approach, considering potential unintended consequences. It promotes critical thinking about the potential impact of this approach on airlines, passengers, and the broader market.\n\n5. USEFUL: This question addresses potential counterarguments, such as the possibility that airlines may pass on increased compensation costs to consumers. It encourages the reader to consider alternative perspectives and whether the author has adequately addressed these concerns.\n\n6. USEFUL: This question assesses the realism and fairness of the obligation on passengers to minimize costs by arranging alternate flights or other means to get to their destination. It prompts the reader to think critically about the burden this places on passengers and whether it is a reasonable expectation.\n\nAll six questions are classified as USEFUL because they challenge assumptions, require evidence, scrutinize specific proposals, evaluate fairness and reasonableness, address counterarguments, and assess the realism and fairness of certain expectations. These questions encourage critical thinking and analysis of the argument, making them valuable for evaluating the validity of the claims presented.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Carefully analyze each question's strengths and weaknesses based on the intervention and LLM feedback.\n2. Revise each question to be clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives.\n3. Avoid vague, obvious, or out-of-scope questions.\n4.

What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

What is the relevance of the variability in customer service information to the argument that the airline industry cannot be left to self-monitor?\n2. How does this variability directly impact the safety of peanut-allergic individuals?\n3. How do the psychological effects of incomplete or inaccurate information from airline customer service departments compare to the physical risks associated with peanut allergies?\n4. Is this comparison valid in the context of the argument?\n5. What is the basis for assuming that the airline industry's self-monitoring would lead to a higher risk of death?\n6. Is this assumption supported by the text or external evidence?\n7. Can the anecdotal stories of families affected by peanut allergies be considered representative of the entire airline industry?\n8. Are they isolated incidents that do not warrant industry-wide regulation?\n9.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content.

During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d.

And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company.

Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

Is Javier's assumption that flyers will make poor decisions based on delay notifications a valid reason to reconsider the requirement for airlines to provide such notifications?\n2. Does Javier's personal experience as a frequent traveler provide sufficient evidence to support his claims about the potential problems with requiring airlines to give notification of delays?\n3. Is it reasonable to expect airlines to provide accurate estimates of delay times, given Javier's acknowledgment that many issues are unavoidable and unpredictable?\n4. Does Javier's argument that flyers need to \"grow up\" and take responsibility for their own decisions imply that airlines have no responsibility to provide accurate and timely information to their customers?\n5. Is Javier's concern about flyers missing flights due to delayed notifications a legitimate reason to reconsider the requirement, or is it a red herring?\n6. Does Javier's statement that flyers \"can't have it both ways\" imply a false dichotomy between receiving timely notifications and taking personal responsibility for one's travel plans?\n\nANSWER:",

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated?

During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d.

What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"secretcurse: \"The first debate was already limited to five people\nAccording to the FEC\n171 people have officially declared their candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination with the FEC (sort by party to see the 171 people a bit easier)\nDo you think every single one of the 171 people that have filed the paperwork with the FEC declaring their candidacy deserves their fair shot at expressing themselves at the first debate\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated?

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"there are a number of issues that we should be addressing\nI have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS\nIt does involve going after them online\nwe need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize , even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere\neventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa\nend their claim of being a Caliphate\nWe 're making progress\nOur military is assisting in Iraq\nwe 're hoping that within the year we 'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq\nreally squeeze them in Syria\nwe have to be cognizant of the fact that they 've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them\nforeign money\nforeign weapons\nwe have to make this the top priority\nI would also do everything possible to take out their leadership\nI was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state\nincluding , of course , taking out bin Laden\nwe need to go after Baghdadi , as well\nmake that one of our organizing principles\nwe 've got to defeat ISIS\nwe 've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nCLINTON: \"there are a number of issues that we should be addressing\nI have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS\nIt does involve going after them online\nwe need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize , even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere\neventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa\nend their claim of being a Caliphate\nWe 're making progress\nOur military is assisting in Iraq\nwe 're hoping that within the year we 'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq\nreally squeeze them in Syria\nwe have to be cognizant of the fact that they 've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them\nforeign money\nforeign weapons\nwe have to make this the top priority\nI would also do everything possible to take out their leadership\nI was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state\nincluding , of course , taking out bin Laden\nwe need to go after Baghdadi , as well\nmake that one of our organizing principles\nwe 've got to defeat ISIS\nwe 've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What specific steps would Clinton take to \"go after\" ISIS online?\n2. How would she balance this effort with concerns about online censorship and freedom of speech?\n3. How does Clinton plan to address the root causes of radicalization, rather than just its online symptoms, in order to prevent new recruits from joining ISIS?\n4. What evidence is there that Clinton's previous efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership, including bin Laden, have had a lasting impact on the organization's ability to operate and recruit new members?\n5. How would Clinton's plan to support Arab and Kurdish partners to take out ISIS in Raqqa address the complex sectarian and ethnic dynamics at play in the region?\n6. What specific measures would Clinton take to disrupt ISIS's propaganda efforts online?\n7. How would she counter the potential backlash from ISIS's online supporters?\n8.

What specific steps would Clinton take to \"go after\" ISIS online?\n**UNHELPFUL**: The text already mentions that Clinton's plan involves working with tech companies to prevent ISIS from using the internet to radicalize people. Asking for specific steps might be too detailed and not necessarily relevant to the overall argument.\n\n2. How would she balance this effort with concerns about online censorship and freedom of speech?\n**USEFUL**: This question challenges Clinton's plan by highlighting a potential trade-off between combating ISIS online and protecting freedom of speech. It requires critical thinking about the implications of her proposal.\n\n3. How does Clinton plan to address the root causes of radicalization, rather than just its online symptoms, in order to prevent new recruits from joining ISIS?\n**USEFUL**: This question gets at the underlying assumptions of Clinton's plan and challenges her to think more deeply about the causes of radicalization. It's a crucial aspect of evaluating the effectiveness of her proposal.\n\n4. What evidence is there that Clinton's previous efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership, including bin Laden, have had a lasting impact on the organization's ability to operate and recruit new members?\n**USEFUL**: This question asks for evidence to support Clinton's claim that her previous efforts were successful, which is essential for evaluating the credibility of her plan to defeat ISIS.\n\n5. How would Clinton's plan to support Arab and Kurdish partners to take out ISIS in Raqqa address the complex sectarian and ethnic dynamics at play in the region?\n**USEFUL**: This question highlights the complexity of the region and challenges Clinton to think about the potential unintended consequences of her plan. It requires critical thinking about the regional dynamics and how they might impact the success of her proposal.\n\n6. What specific measures would Clinton take to disrupt ISIS's propaganda efforts online?\n**UNHELPFUL**: Similar to question 1, this question asks for too much detail and might not be relevant to the overall argument. Clinton has already mentioned that she wants to disrupt ISIS's propaganda efforts online, so asking for specific measures might not add much value.\n\n7. How would she counter the potential backlash from ISIS's online supporters?\n**USEFUL**: This question challenges Clinton to think about the potential consequences of her actions and how she would respond to a potential backlash. It requires critical thinking about the online dynamics and how they might impact the success of her proposal.\n\n8. How does Clinton plan to prioritize the fight against ISIS over other pressing foreign policy issues?\n**INVALID**: This question is not directly related to the text, which focuses on Clinton's plan to defeat ISIS, not on how she would prioritize it relative to other foreign policy issues.\n\n9. What resources would she allocate to this effort?\n**UNHELPFUL**: While resources are an important consideration, asking about specific allocations might be too detailed and not necessarily relevant to the overall argument. Clinton has already mentioned that she wants to make defeating ISIS a top priority, so asking about resources might not add much value.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Carefully analyze each question's strengths and weaknesses based on the intervention and LLM feedback.\n2. Revise each question to be clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives.\n3. Avoid vague, obvious, or out-of-scope questions.\n4. Integrate the evaluator's feedback carefully for improvements.\n\nFinally:\n- Return a list of improved questions, ranked from strongest to weakest based on quality and depth.\n- Make sure the questions are open-ended and meaningful for critical analysis.",

Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"MT: \"I don’t think you just said the opposite of them was neutral\nSo if they're virtues, doesn’t that imply that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral?\nBut, hold on\nIsn’t it simply the case that buying a cup of coffee is something which is substantially less demanding than working up a long-term interest rate?\nTherefore isn’t it a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases\nbecause the knowledge is bounded?\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nMT: \"I don’t think you just said the opposite of them was neutral\nSo if they're virtues, doesn’t that imply that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral?\nBut, hold on\nIsn’t it simply the case that buying a cup of coffee is something which is substantially less demanding than working up a long-term interest rate?\nTherefore isn’t it a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases\nbecause the knowledge is bounded?\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the assumption that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral a valid one?\n2. Does it necessarily follow from the virtues themselves?\n3. Does the comparison between buying a cup of coffee and working up a long-term interest rate accurately capture the complexity of financial decision-making?\n4. Is the concept of \"bounded knowledge\" sufficient to justify state intervention in financial matters?\n5. What are the potential consequences of such intervention?\n6. Does the speaker's argument rely on an overly simplistic distinction between \"virtues\" and their opposites?\n7. What nuances might be overlooked as a result?\n8. How does the speaker's assertion that buying a cup of coffee is \"substantially less demanding\" than working up a long-term interest rate relate to the actual cognitive demands of financial decision-making?\n9. Can the speaker's argument be applied consistently across different domains, or does it rely on a specific set of assumptions about human behavior and decision-making that may not hold universally?\n\nANSWER:",

Is the assumption that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral a valid one?\n**USEFUL**: This question challenges the speaker's implicit assumption and requires critical evaluation of the moral implications of thrift and prudence.\n\n2. Does it necessarily follow from the virtues themselves?\n**USEFUL**: This question probes the logical connection between the virtues and their opposites, encouraging critical thinking about the speaker's argument.\n\n3. Does the comparison between buying a cup of coffee and working up a long-term interest rate accurately capture the complexity of financial decision-making?\n**USEFUL**: This question questions the validity of the speaker's analogy and requires consideration of the complexities of financial decision-making.\n\n4. Is the concept of \"bounded knowledge\" sufficient to justify state intervention in financial matters?\n**USEFUL**: This question challenges the speaker's justification for state intervention and requires evaluation of the relationship between bounded knowledge and state intervention.\n\n5. What are the potential consequences of such intervention?\n**UNHELPFUL**: While this question is related to the topic, it is too broad and open-ended, and answering it would require a lengthy and complex discussion.\n\n6.

How does the speaker's assertion that buying a cup of coffee is \"substantially less demanding\" than working up a long-term interest rate relate to the actual cognitive demands of financial decision-making?\n**USEFUL**: This question challenges the speaker's assumption about the relative demands of different financial decisions and requires consideration of the cognitive demands of financial decision-making.\n\n9. Can the speaker's argument be applied consistently across different domains, or does it rely on a specific set of assumptions about human behavior and decision-making that may not hold universally?\n**INVALID**: This question is too vague and could be applied to any text, and it does not specifically challenge the speaker's argument.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Carefully analyze each question's strengths and weaknesses based on the intervention and LLM feedback.\n2. Revise each question to be clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives.\n3. Avoid vague, obvious, or out-of-scope questions.\n4.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1.

What are the \"unintended consequences\" of community policing that Clinton mentions, and how do these consequences impact the overall assessment of this approach?\n5.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated?

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nkateinhawaii: \"I personally have suffered from peanut allergies for over 40 years.\nIf there are packaged peanuts served on board a flight, it's 100% guaranteed that I will have a reaction from the peanut dust.\nI do not agree with a buffer zone for a couple of reasons.\nFor me, it's the dust in the air.\nSomeone posted that the air circulates peanut dust right out of the air\nbut apparently not quick enough to prevent a life threatening reaction.\nYou know, airlines tried to create nonsmoking zones on airplanes but that didn't work either.\nI have been on flights where nasty (and do I mean NASTY) flight attendants have made sarcastic remarks about me and my allergies especially on one Delta flight.\nNorthwest was great\nbecause they respected their passengers enough to address their concerns\nand prohibited peanuts altogether.\nIt was as much a relief to walk onto one of their flights as it was to walk onto one of the first smoke free flights!\nSmokers use to use the same logic and reasoning to justify smoking on flights as these peanut proponents are using now.\nI flew on many smoking flights and never needed to inject myself so that I could breathe\nI can't say the same for flights with peanuts.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the comparison between peanut allergies and smoking on flights a valid one, considering the differences in how allergens and smoke affect individuals?\n2. Does the author's personal experience with peanut allergies and reactions on flights provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that buffer zones are ineffective?\n3. How does the author's assertion that the air circulation system on planes is unable to remove peanut dust quickly enough to prevent a reaction align with the claim that someone posted about the air circulating peanut dust out of the air?\n4. Is the author's positive experience with Northwest Airlines, which prohibited peanuts altogether, representative of a viable solution for all airlines, considering potential logistical and financial implications?\n5. Does the author's characterization of flight attendants who have made sarcastic remarks about their allergies as \"nasty\" unfairly generalize the attitudes of all flight attendants towards passengers with allergies?\n6. Can the author's claim that they never needed to inject themselves to breathe on smoking flights be used as evidence that peanut allergies are more severe or deserving of accommodation than other allergies or sensitivities?\n\nANSWER:",

USEFUL: This question challenges the author's comparison between peanut allergies and smoking on flights, which is a crucial aspect of their argument. By questioning the validity of this comparison, the reader is forced to think critically about the similarities and differences between the two issues.\n\n2. USEFUL: This question raises concerns about the author's reliance on personal experience as evidence for the ineffectiveness of buffer zones. It encourages the reader to consider whether anecdotal evidence is sufficient to support a broader claim.\n\n3. UNHELPFUL: This question is more of a reading comprehension question, as it asks the reader to clarify the relationship between two specific claims made in the text. While it may help to clarify the author's argument, it does not challenge the argument in a significant way.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question invites the reader to consider the practical implications of implementing a peanut-free policy on all airlines, as the author suggests. It encourages critical thinking about the potential logistical and financial challenges of such a policy.\n\n5. UNHELPFUL: This question focuses on the author's characterization of certain flight attendants, which is not a crucial aspect of their argument. While it may be a valid critique of the author's tone, it does not significantly challenge the argument itself.\n\n6.

    "LLM_feedback": "Here are the classifications for each question:\n\n1. USEFUL: This question challenges the author's comparison between peanut allergies and smoking on flights, which is a crucial aspect of their argument. By questioning the validity of this comparison, the reader is forced to think critically about the similarities and differences between the two issues.\n\n2. USEFUL: This question raises concerns about the author's reliance on personal experience as evidence for the ineffectiveness of buffer zones. It encourages the reader to consider whether anecdotal evidence is sufficient to support a broader claim.\n\n3. UNHELPFUL: This question is more of a reading comprehension question, as it asks the reader to clarify the relationship between two specific claims made in the text. While it may help to clarify the author's argument, it does not challenge the argument in a significant way.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question invites the reader to consider the practical implications of implementing a peanut-free policy on all airlines, as the author suggests. It encourages critical thinking about the potential logistical and financial challenges of such a policy.\n\n5. UNHELPFUL: This question focuses on the author's characterization of certain flight attendants, which is not a crucial aspect of their argument. While it may be a valid critique of the author's tone, it does not significantly challenge the argument itself.\n\n6. INVALID: This question is not relevant to the author's main argument, which is about the need for peanut-free flights or buffer zones. The author's experience on smoking flights is used as a rhetorical device to illustrate the similarities between the two issues, but it is not presented as evidence for the severity of peanut allergies.",
    "improved_questions": "After analyzing the questions, intervention, and LLM feedback, I've revised each question to improve its clarity, specificity, and ability to challenge key assumptions. Here is the list of improved questions, ranked from strongest to weakest:\n\n1. **Revised Question 1:** How does the author's comparison between peanut allergies and smoking on flights account for the differences in how allergens and smoke affect individuals, and what implications might this have for the proposed solutions?\n\nThis revised question maintains its usefulness while becoming more specific and nuanced. It encourages critical thinking about the similarities and differences between the two issues.\n\n2. **Revised Question 2:** To what extent can the author's personal experience with peanut allergies and reactions on flights be generalized to support the claim that buffer zones are ineffective, and what additional evidence might be needed to substantiate this claim?\n\nThis revised question remains useful while becoming more specific about the limitations of anecdotal evidence. It encourages the reader to consider the need for more comprehensive evidence.\n\n3. **Revised Question 4:** What are the potential logistical, financial, and social implications of implementing a peanut-free policy on all airlines, and how might these challenges be addressed?\n\nThis revised question builds upon the original's usefulness by becoming more specific about the potential challenges and encouraging critical thinking about solutions.\n\n4. **Revised Question 6:** How does the author's use of their experience on smoking flights as a rhetorical device influence the reader's perception of the severity of peanut allergies, and what are the implications of this comparison for the broader discussion about accommodating allergies and sensitivities?\n\nThis revised question addresses the original's invalidity by refocusing on the rhetorical device's impact and the broader discussion about accommodating allergies.\n\n5. **Revised Question 3:** How does the author's assertion about the air circulation system's inability to remove peanut dust quickly enough to prevent a reaction relate to the overall argument about buffer zones, and what are the implications of this claim for the proposed solutions?\n\nThis revised question attempts to make the original more useful by connecting it to the broader argument and encouraging critical thinking about the implications.\n\n6. **Revised Question 5:** While the author's characterization of certain flight attendants is not central to their argument, how might the tone and language used in the intervention influence the reader's perception of the issue, and what are the implications of this tone for the broader discussion?\n\nThis revised question acknowledges the original's unhelpfulness while attempting to make it more relevant by exploring the tone's impact on the reader's perception.\n\nRanking:\n\n1. Revised Question 1\n2. Revised Question 2\n3. Revised Question 4\n4. Revised Question 6\n5. Revised Question 3\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"I would love to respond\nI got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama\nYou treated him with terrible disrespect\nI watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are\nIt does n't work that way\nYou were after him\nyou were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb , very famous pictures\nI do n't think you can deny that\njust last week , your campaign manager said it was true\nwhen you tried to act holier than thou , it really does n't work\nas far as the lawsuit , yes , when I was very young , I went into my father 's company , had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens , and we , along with many , many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued\nWe settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt\nIt was very easy to do\nI notice you bring that up a lot\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

Can Trump's denial of guilt in the lawsuit be taken as evidence of his innocence, or does the settlement imply otherwise?\n4. Does Trump's assertion that many other companies were also sued in the federal lawsuit diminish his own company's responsibility in the matter?\n5. Is Trump's claim that Clinton's campaign sent out pictures of Obama in a certain garb a verifiable fact, or is it an unsubstantiated accusation?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"travellots: \"If compensation is not high enough, the airlines will not have an incentive to schedule properly.\nIt is not fair to allow airlines to discriminate against lower fared passengers or \"free\" passengers\nsince it is the airline, not the passenger or government, who gave that passenger a seat.\nOtherwise, airlines can advertise low fares or con you into using them to build up your \"miles\" and then always bump you for someone who paid more.\nIn away,it is the same as being able to increase your ticket price anytime after purchase.\nWhen you are bumped, there are a lot of hidden extra costs\nIt irks me that airlines seem to be treating passengers more and more as if they have nothing better to do but wait around in airports and not get to where the airline promised to bring them.\nAgain, the airline sets the agreed price or miles for a seat, no one else.\nThe incentives to the airline should be to get all confirmed passengers (regardless of price paid) to the destination promised.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\ntravellots: \"If compensation is not high enough, the airlines will not have an incentive to schedule properly.\nIt is not fair to allow airlines to discriminate against lower fared passengers or \"free\" passengers\nsince it is the airline, not the passenger or government, who gave that passenger a seat.\nOtherwise, airlines can advertise low fares or con you into using them to build up your \"miles\" and then always bump you for someone who paid more.\nIn away,it is the same as being able to increase your ticket price anytime after purchase.\nWhen you are bumped, there are a lot of hidden extra costs\nIt irks me that airlines seem to be treating passengers more and more as if they have nothing better to do but wait around in airports and not get to where the airline promised to bring them.\nAgain, the airline sets the agreed price or miles for a seat, no one else.\nThe incentives to the airline should be to get all confirmed passengers (regardless of price paid) to the destination promised.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the assumption that airlines will not have an incentive to schedule properly if compensation is not high enough supported by evidence or logical reasoning?\n2. Does the text provide a clear explanation for why airlines should not be allowed to discriminate against lower-fared passengers, beyond stating that it is \"not fair\"?\n3. How does the author's comparison of bumping passengers to increasing ticket prices after purchase accurately reflect the situation, and is this analogy valid?\n4. What specific \"hidden extra costs\" does the author refer to when a passenger is bumped, and are these costs quantifiable?\n5. Is the author's assertion that airlines are treating passengers as if they have nothing better to do but wait around in airports supported by empirical evidence or anecdotal experience?\n6. Does the text provide a convincing argument for why airlines should prioritize getting all confirmed passengers to their destination, regardless of price paid, over other potential priorities such as maximizing revenue or efficiency?\n\nANSWER:",

It requires the reader to think critically about the evidence or logical reasoning behind this assumption.\n\n2. USEFUL: This question highlights the lack of clear explanation for why airlines should not be allowed to discriminate against lower-fared passengers.

It requires the reader to think critically about whether this comparison accurately reflects the situation and whether it is a valid way to frame the issue.\n\n4. UNHELPFUL: While this question is related to the text, it is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis. The answer to this question might be a list of specific costs, but it does not challenge any assumption or argument in the text.\n\n5. UNHELPFUL: Similar to question 4, this question is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis. The answer to this question might be an anecdotal experience or empirical evidence, but it does not challenge any assumption or argument in the text.\n\n6. USEFUL: This question evaluates the convincingness of the author's argument for why airlines should prioritize getting all confirmed passengers to their destination. It requires the reader to think critically about the values and priorities that underlie the author's claim and whether they are convincing.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify any of these classifications!\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Carefully analyze each question's strengths and weaknesses based on the intervention and LLM feedback.\n2. Revise each question to be clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives.\n3. Avoid vague, obvious, or out-of-scope questions.\n4.

During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\ndberger: \"Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts\nbut all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts\nand will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.\nSo you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away\nand the airlines will do nothing to help you.\nAgain all nuts should be banned from airplanes unless it is your own private plane  then go ahead and eat what you want.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What is the basis for the claim that all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts, and is this a universal policy across all airlines?\n2. Is the scenario presented, where a person can eat peanuts on a \"nut-free\" flight, a realistic representation of airline policies and practices?\n3. Does the author provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that airlines will \"do nothing\" to help a passenger with a nut allergy in the presence of peanuts?\n4. Is the proposed solution of banning all nuts from airplanes a reasonable and feasible measure, considering the logistical challenges of enforcing such a ban?\n5. How does the author's suggestion of allowing nuts on private planes address the issue of nut allergies on commercial flights, and is this a relevant distinction?\n6. Does the text provide a clear explanation of the risks associated with nut allergies on flights, and is the proposed ban on nuts an effective way to mitigate these risks?\n\nANSWER:",

What is the basis for the claim that all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts, and is this a universal policy across all airlines?\n2. Is the scenario presented, where a person can eat peanuts on a \"nut-free\" flight, a realistic representation of airline policies and practices?\n3.

Does the text provide a clear explanation of the risks associated with nut allergies on flights, and is the proposed ban on nuts an effective way to mitigate these risks?\n\n  Also use:\n- Evaluator (LLM) feedback: Here are the classifications for each question:\n\n1. USEFUL\nThe question challenges the assumption that all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts, and asks for evidence to support this claim. This is a crucial aspect of the argument, as it affects the validity of the author's proposal to ban nuts from airplanes.\n\n2. USEFUL\nThe question questions the realism of the scenario presented, which is a key part of the author's argument. If the scenario is not representative of actual airline policies and practices, it undermines the author's claim that airlines will \"do nothing\" to help a passenger with a nut allergy.\n\n3. USEFUL\nThe question asks for evidence to support the claim that airlines will \"do nothing\" to help a passenger with a nut allergy, which is a critical assumption in the author's argument. If there is no evidence to support this claim, it weakens the author's proposal to ban nuts from airplanes.\n\n4. UNHELPFUL\nThe question is related to the text, but it is too complex to be practical. Evaluating the feasibility of enforcing a ban on nuts from airplanes would require a detailed analysis of airline policies, logistics, and resources, which is beyond the scope of the text.\n\n5. INVALID\nThe question is unrelated to the main argument of the text, which is about banning nuts from commercial flights. The author's suggestion of allowing nuts on private planes is a tangential point that does not affect the validity of the proposal to ban nuts from commercial flights.\n\n6. INVALID\nThe question is a reading-comprehension question, as it asks for a summary of the text's explanation of the risks associated with nut allergies on flights. Additionally, the question of whether the proposed ban on nuts is an effective way to mitigate these risks is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Carefully analyze each question's strengths and weaknesses based on the intervention and LLM feedback.\n2. Revise each question to be clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives.\n3. Avoid vague, obvious, or out-of-scope questions.\n4. Integrate the evaluator's feedback carefully for improvements.\n\nFinally:\n- Return a list of improved questions, ranked from strongest to weakest based on quality and depth.\n- Make sure the questions are open-ended and meaningful for critical analysis.",

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented.

Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit\nwhen I look at what you have proposed , you have what is called now the Trump loophole\nit would so advantage you and the business you do\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

What is the basis for Clinton's assertion that the US is \"on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy,\" and what specific indicators or data support this optimistic outlook?\n5. Can Clinton's plan to invest in clean energy be considered a viable solution to address the economic losses mentioned earlier, such as the $13 trillion in lost family wealth, and if so, how?\n6.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nCLINTON: \"Let 's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald\nfirst , NATO\nNATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5\nyou know the only time it 's ever been invoked ?\nAfter 9/11 , when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism\nsomething that they still are doing by our side\nWith respect to Iran , when I became secretary of state , Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb\nThey had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration\nThey had built covert facilities\nThey had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away\nwe had sanctioned them\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is Clinton's reference to NATO's invocation of Article 5 after 9/11 a valid example of the alliance's effectiveness in addressing terrorism, or is it an isolated incident?\n2. Does Clinton's statement that Iran was \"weeks away\" from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb when she became secretary of state accurately reflect the complexity of nuclear development timelines?\n3. What evidence supports Clinton's claim that Iran had \"mastered the nuclear fuel cycle\" under the Bush administration, and is this a fair characterization of the situation?\n4. Is Clinton's emphasis on Iran's covert facilities and centrifuges a comprehensive representation of the country's nuclear program, or are there other important factors being omitted?\n5. How does Clinton's mention of sanctions against Iran relate to her overall argument about the country's nuclear program, and is this a convincing demonstration of effective diplomacy?\n6. Does Clinton's framing of NATO's involvement in Afghanistan as a successful example of cooperation against terrorism overlook potential criticisms or complexities of the alliance's role in the conflict?\n\nANSWER:",

USEFUL\nThis question challenges Clinton's use of NATO's invocation of Article 5 as an example of the alliance's effectiveness in addressing terrorism. It requires critical thinking to evaluate whether this instance is representative of NATO's capabilities or just an isolated incident.\n\n2. USEFUL\nThis question questions the accuracy of Clinton's statement about Iran's nuclear development timeline. It encourages critical evaluation of the complexity of nuclear development and whether Clinton's statement oversimplifies the issue.\n\n3. USEFUL\nThis question seeks evidence to support Clinton's claim about Iran's nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. It promotes critical thinking about the validity of Clinton's statement and whether it is a fair characterization of the situation.\n\n4. USEFUL\nThis question challenges Clinton's representation of Iran's nuclear program, asking whether she omits important factors. It encourages critical evaluation of the comprehensiveness of Clinton's argument.\n\n5. UNHELPFUL\nThis question is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis. Clinton's mention of sanctions is a minor point in her argument, and evaluating its convincingness as a demonstration of effective diplomacy is too complex and not directly relevant to the main argument.\n\n6. USEFUL\nThis question challenges Clinton's framing of NATO's involvement in Afghanistan as a successful example of cooperation against terrorism. It encourages critical thinking about potential criticisms or complexities of the alliance's role in the conflict, which is relevant to evaluating Clinton's argument.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify any of these classifications!\n\nYour task is to:\n1.

It challenges Melanie to provide concrete evidence and consider alternative perspectives.\n\n2. **Can Melanie provide specific examples or case studies that illustrate how the State's current approach has created victims, and what are the underlying mechanisms by which this harm occurs?**\n\nThis revised question combines elements of original questions 5 and 6. It asks Melanie to provide concrete examples and explain the underlying mechanisms, making it a more nuanced and thought-provoking question.\n\n3. **How does Melanie's emphasis on restoring independence and personal responsibility address potential systemic or structural factors, such as socioeconomic inequality or institutional racism, that may contribute to the problems she's identified?**\n\nThis revised question builds on original question 9 and incorporates the evaluator's feedback. It challenges Melanie to consider the broader structural context and how her proposed solution might interact with these factors.\n\n**Middle-tier Questions (4-6)**\n\n4. **What are the key assumptions underlying Melanie's claim that the State's non-judgmentalism has caused harm, and how does she justify these assumptions?**\n\nThis revised question is a more focused version of original question 1. It asks Melanie to articulate her assumptions and justify them, making it a more targeted and thought-provoking question.\n\n5. **How does Melanie define 'victims' in the context of her argument, and what are the implications of this definition for her proposed solution?**\n\nThis revised question is a more nuanced version of original question 5. It asks Melanie to clarify her definition of 'victims' and consider the implications of this definition.\n\n6. **What are the potential risks or unintended consequences of Melanie's proposed solution, and how does she plan to mitigate these risks?**\n\nThis revised question is a new addition that challenges Melanie to think critically about the potential risks and unintended consequences of her proposed solution.\n\n**Weakest Questions (7-9)**\n\n7. **What does Melanie mean by 'carefully calibrated' help, and how does she plan to implement this type of support?**\n\nThis revised question is a more focused version of original question 7. While it is still a somewhat vague question, it is more targeted and relevant to Melanie's argument.\n\n8. **How does Melanie's proposed solution address the needs of diverse populations, such as marginalized communities or individuals with complex needs?**\n\nThis revised question is a new addition that challenges Melanie to consider the needs of diverse populations. While it is a relevant question, it is somewhat more obvious and less thought-provoking than the stronger questions.\n\n9. **What is the relationship between Melanie's proposed solution and existing social welfare policies or programs?**\n\nThis revised question is a new addition that asks Melanie to consider the broader policy context. While it is a relevant question, it is somewhat more out-of-scope and less thought-provoking than the stronger questions.\n\nNote that the ranking of questions from strongest to weakest is subjective and based on my analysis of the questions' strengths and weaknesses.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented.

Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible?

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"let 's start the clock again , Lester\nWe 've looked at your tax proposals\nI do n't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you 're referring to that would cause the repatriation , bringing back of money that 's stranded overseas\nI happen to support that\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"howie: \"First, stop reading that propaganda magazine.\nPublications like that only serve to create fear in minds like yours.\nSecond, how old is your kid?\nIf under 5, relax the sensitivity will probably go away by the time he is 5.\nThird, go to a real doctor  not an allergist and see if there is really even a problem at all.\nThis supposed plague of food allergies is the result of very clever advertising by this profession of pseudoscientists.\nAllergists are not doctors.\nI sincerely doubt you \"know plenty of people who will die if they do have peanuts or breathe in peanut dust\".\nAlmost noone is actually that allergic.\nLot's of people think they are much worse off than they really are.\nMethinks you have an agenda.\nHighly suspicious that the child of a physician who is hyper aware of bad things that can happen coincidentally has not one, but three life threatening allergies.\nHave you heard of Munchasen by Proxy?\nDo you realize that most kids have mild reactions to various food items that they invariably grow out of by the age of 5?\nFood allergies have to be the most overblown imagined health problem of our time.\nHypochondriacs all.\"\n < this message is answering to > \njsooudi: \"I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.\nMy son's dairy allergy is severe,\nand he has had numerous lifethreatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk,\nwhich required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.\nTests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse,\nbut fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut;\nhe put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.\nI've traveled with my children\nand despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanutfree buffer zone or flight.\nSeveral years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.\n(So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)\nI've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because \"it was their right.\"\nFortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.\nNow that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.\nHowever, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.\nMy son's dairy allergy is quite severe.\nThe world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.\nIf his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.\nIf he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.\nWithout epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.\nBut milk is ubiquitous,\nand milk allergy relatively uncommon,\nso we must protect ourselves.\nPeanut allergy is common,\nand it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.\nSo why is this a big problem?\nThe vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.\nPeanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein,\nand would be of little risk in an airborne environment.\nAs a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.\nI am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.\nIn addition, most epipens come in two pack doses,\neach of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.\nWhich in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.\nI've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive,\nand are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.\nI think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.\nOf course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.\nBut I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.\nThis restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.\n\"Hi.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nhowie: \"First, stop reading that propaganda magazine.\nPublications like that only serve to create fear in minds like yours.\nSecond, how old is your kid?\nIf under 5, relax the sensitivity will probably go away by the time he is 5.\nThird, go to a real doctor  not an allergist and see if there is really even a problem at all.\nThis supposed plague of food allergies is the result of very clever advertising by this profession of pseudoscientists.\nAllergists are not doctors.\nI sincerely doubt you \"know plenty of people who will die if they do have peanuts or breathe in peanut dust\".\nAlmost noone is actually that allergic.\nLot's of people think they are much worse off than they really are.\nMethinks you have an agenda.\nHighly suspicious that the child of a physician who is hyper aware of bad things that can happen coincidentally has not one, but three life threatening allergies.\nHave you heard of Munchasen by Proxy?\nDo you realize that most kids have mild reactions to various food items that they invariably grow out of by the age of 5?\nFood allergies have to be the most overblown imagined health problem of our time.\nHypochondriacs all.\"\n < this message is answering to > \njsooudi: \"I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.\nMy son's dairy allergy is severe,\nand he has had numerous lifethreatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk,\nwhich required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.\nTests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse,\nbut fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut;\nhe put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.\nI've traveled with my children\nand despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanutfree buffer zone or flight.\nSeveral years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.\n(So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)\nI've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because \"it was their right.\"\nFortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.\nNow that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.\nHowever, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.\nMy son's dairy allergy is quite severe.\nThe world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.\nIf his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.\nIf he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.\nWithout epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.\nBut milk is ubiquitous,\nand milk allergy relatively uncommon,\nso we must protect ourselves.\nPeanut allergy is common,\nand it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.\nSo why is this a big problem?\nThe vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.\nPeanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein,\nand would be of little risk in an airborne environment.\nAs a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.\nI am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.\nIn addition, most epipens come in two pack doses,\neach of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.\nWhich in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.\nI've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive,\nand are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.\nI think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.\nOf course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.\nBut I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.\nThis restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.\n\"Hi.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"I have much better judgment than she does\nThere 's no question about that\nI also have a much better temperament than she has\nshe spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising\nthey get Madison Avenue into a room\nthey put names\ntemperament , let 's go after\nmy strongest asset , maybe by far , is my temperament\nI have a winning temperament\nI know how to win\nShe does not have a\nWrong\nthere 's a person with a temperament that 's got a problem\nThe AFL-CIO the other day , behind the blue screen , I do n't know who you were talking to , Secretary Clinton , but you were totally out of control\n I do n't know who you were talking to\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nTRUMP: \"I have much better judgment than she does\nThere 's no question about that\nI also have a much better temperament than she has\nshe spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising\nthey get Madison Avenue into a room\nthey put names\ntemperament , let 's go after\nmy strongest asset , maybe by far , is my temperament\nI have a winning temperament\nI know how to win\nShe does not have a\nWrong\nthere 's a person with a temperament that 's got a problem\nThe AFL-CIO the other day , behind the blue screen , I do n't know who you were talking to , Secretary Clinton , but you were totally out of control\n I do n't know who you were talking to\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What specific evidence does Trump provide to support his claim that he has a better temperament than Clinton, and is this evidence sufficient to justify his assertion?\n2. How does Trump's definition of a \"winning temperament\" relate to his ability to make sound judgments, and is this connection logically supported?\n3. Is Trump's criticism of Clinton's advertising expenses relevant to her temperament, and does this critique provide insight into his own judgment?\n4. What is the basis for Trump's claim that Clinton was \"totally out of control\" during her conversation with the AFL-CIO, and is this characterization accurate?\n5. Does Trump's emphasis on his own temperament as his \"strongest asset\" imply that he prioritizes personal qualities over policy expertise or experience, and is this prioritization justified?\n6. How does Trump's assertion that he \"knows how to win\" relate to his ability to make decisions that benefit the greater good, rather than just his own interests, and is this connection supported by evidence?\n\nANSWER:",

USEFUL: This question challenges Trump's claim about his temperament and requires evidence to support it. It encourages critical thinking about the validity of Trump's assertion.\n\n2. USEFUL: This question examines the logical connection between Trump's definition of a \"winning temperament\" and his ability to make sound judgments. It requires analysis of Trump's argument and evaluation of its logical coherence.\n\n3. UNHELPFUL: While this question is related to the text, it is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.

It encourages critical thinking about the accuracy of Trump's assertion.\n\n5. USEFUL: This question examines the implications of Trump's emphasis on his temperament as his \"strongest asset.\" It requires analysis of Trump's priorities and evaluation of whether they are justified.\n\n6. USEFUL: This question challenges Trump's assertion that he \"knows how to win\" and requires evidence to support the connection between this claim and his ability to make decisions that benefit the greater good. It encourages critical thinking about the validity of Trump's assertion and its implications for his decision-making.\n\nOverall, questions 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are classified as USEFUL because they challenge Trump's claims, require evidence to support them, and encourage critical thinking about the validity of his assertions. Question 3 is classified as UNHELPFUL because it is tangential to the main issue and unlikely to lead to a productive discussion.

Trump's criticism of Clinton's advertising expenses is a separate issue from his claim about his temperament, and this question may lead to a tangential discussion.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question challenges Trump's characterization of Clinton as \"totally out of control\" and requires evidence to support this claim. It encourages critical thinking about the accuracy of Trump's assertion.\n\n5. USEFUL: This question examines the implications of Trump's emphasis on his temperament as his \"strongest asset.\" It requires analysis of Trump's priorities and evaluation of whether they are justified.\n\n6. USEFUL: This question challenges Trump's assertion that he \"knows how to win\" and requires evidence to support the connection between this claim and his ability to make decisions that benefit the greater good. It encourages critical thinking about the validity of Trump's assertion and its implications for his decision-making.\n\nOverall, questions 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are classified as USEFUL because they challenge Trump's claims, require evidence to support them, and encourage critical thinking about the validity of his assertions. Question 3 is classified as UNHELPFUL because it is tangential to the main issue and unlikely to lead to a productive discussion. None of the questions are classified as INVALID because they all relate to the text and challenge Trump's arguments in some way.",

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"Doctor-Mom: \"I would support a full ban of peanut products on any airline.\nPeanut reactions can be life threatening.\nAn individual doesn't have to consume the product to have a life threatening reaction.\nThey can have contact or inhalation reactions.\nRestricting to certain flights is not enough,\nas residue can be rampant.\nProviding buffer zones is a thoughtful gesture,\nbut from a practical point of view does not work.\nWith so many food choices available, why are peanuts a necessary choice?\nI am a physician , and author on the subject.\nI have free food allergy online support forums with 3000 members.\nhttp://www.drmomsallergyrx.com/\nI would be more than willing to work with you in any way on this decision making process.\nThe allergic community is so grateful that you are allowing our voices to be heard.\nThe decision you are considering could save many lives.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nDoctor-Mom: \"I would support a full ban of peanut products on any airline.\nPeanut reactions can be life threatening.\nAn individual doesn't have to consume the product to have a life threatening reaction.\nThey can have contact or inhalation reactions.\nRestricting to certain flights is not enough,\nas residue can be rampant.\nProviding buffer zones is a thoughtful gesture,\nbut from a practical point of view does not work.\nWith so many food choices available, why are peanuts a necessary choice?\nI am a physician , and author on the subject.\nI have free food allergy online support forums with 3000 members.\nhttp://www.drmomsallergyrx.com/\nI would be more than willing to work with you in any way on this decision making process.\nThe allergic community is so grateful that you are allowing our voices to be heard.\nThe decision you are considering could save many lives.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1.

Does the fact that the author is a physician and has written on the subject necessarily qualify them as an expert on airline policy and peanut allergies?\n3. Is the comparison between the risk of peanut reactions and the availability of other food choices a valid one, or does it oversimplify the issue?\n4. Can the author's claim that buffer zones are impractical be substantiated by data or is it based on personal opinion?\n5. Is the assertion that a full ban on peanut products is necessary to prevent life-threatening reactions supported by scientific research or is it an overly cautious approach?\n6. Does the author's involvement with online support forums and their willingness to work with the decision-making process introduce a potential bias in their argument, and if so, how can it be addressed?\n\nANSWER:",

What empirical evidence supports the claim that peanut residue is rampant on flights, and how does this evidence justify a full ban on peanut products?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more specific and targeted, requiring the author to provide concrete evidence to support their claim. It also challenges the assumption that a full ban is necessary.\n\n**Rank 2:**\n2. How does the risk of peanut reactions compare to other food allergies, and what alternative measures could be taken to mitigate these risks without implementing a full ban?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more nuanced, encouraging the author to consider alternative perspectives and compare the risk of peanut reactions to other food allergies.\n\n**Rank 3:**\n3. What scientific research supports the assertion that buffer zones are impractical, and what alternative solutions could be explored to minimize the risk of peanut exposure?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more specific, requiring the author to provide scientific research to support their claim. It also encourages the author to explore alternative solutions.\n\n**Rank 4:**\n4. Is a full ban on peanut products the most effective way to prevent life-threatening reactions, or are there other measures that could be taken to achieve the same goal?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more open-ended, encouraging the author to consider alternative perspectives and evaluate the effectiveness of a full ban.\n\n**Rank 5:**\n5. How do the benefits of a full ban on peanut products weigh against the potential drawbacks, such as increased costs or logistical challenges?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more nuanced, encouraging the author to consider the potential trade-offs of a full ban.\n\n**Rank 6:**\n6. (Removed) This question was classified as UNHELPFUL, as it may be seen as an attempt to discredit the author rather than engaging with the substance of their argument.\n\nI removed question 6, as it was deemed UNHELPFUL by the evaluator.

And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company.

Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

Is the assumption that all individuals who are physically present in the society and working should automatically receive coverage a valid one?\n2. Does the message's tone and language, particularly the use of profanity, undermine the credibility of the argument being made?\n3. Is the comparison between the current situation and the past treatment of Republican views on illegal immigrants receiving Obamacare coverage a fair and relevant one?\n4. Does the message provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to support the claim that xenophobia is the primary motivation behind opposition to providing coverage to certain individuals?\n5. Is the assertion that being \"a part of this society\" a sufficient condition for receiving coverage?\n6. What are the implications of this assertion?\n7.

The credibility of the argument can be evaluated separately from the tone and language used.\n\n3. INVALID: The comparison between the current situation and the past treatment of Republican views is not relevant to the argument being made. The message is responding to a specific claim about Democrat presidential candidates, and this comparison does not challenge that claim.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question challenges the assumption that xenophobia is the primary motivation behind opposition to providing coverage. It requires critical thinking about the evidence and reasoning provided to support this claim.\n\n5. USEFUL: This question challenges the assumption that being \"a part of this society\" is a sufficient condition for receiving coverage. It requires critical thinking about the criteria for receiving coverage.\n\n6. INVALID: This question is too vague and could be applied to any text. It does not specifically challenge the argument being made.\n\n7. USEFUL: This question challenges the assumption that presence and contributions in the society are the only factors that should influence the decision to provide coverage. It requires critical thinking about other potential factors that might be relevant.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Carefully analyze each question's strengths and weaknesses based on the intervention and LLM feedback.\n2. Revise each question to be clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives.\n3. Avoid vague, obvious, or out-of-scope questions.\n4. Integrate the evaluator's feedback carefully for improvements.\n\nFinally:\n- Return a list of improved questions, ranked from strongest to weakest based on quality and depth.\n- Make sure the questions are open-ended and meaningful for critical analysis.",

While the LLM feedback classified the original question as UNHELPFUL, this revised question provides a more nuanced exploration of the issue.\n\nThe following questions were eliminated or significantly revised due to their INVALID or UNHELPFUL classification:\n\n* Original question 3 was eliminated due to its INVALID classification, as the comparison between the current situation and the past treatment of Republican views is not relevant to the argument being made.\n* Original question 6 was eliminated due to its INVALID classification, as it is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n\nNote that the ranking of the questions is subjective and based on the analysis of the intervention and LLM feedback.

What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford?

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented.

Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3.

During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d.

What is the basis for Trump's claim that Hillary lacks the \"presidential look\"?\n**USEFUL**: This question challenges Trump's assumption that there is a specific \"look\" required for a president and asks for evidence to support this claim.\n\n2. Is this a valid criterion for evaluating a candidate's qualifications?\n**USEFUL**: This question questions the validity of Trump's criterion for evaluating a candidate's qualifications, which is a crucial aspect of critical thinking.\n\n3. How does Trump's emphasis on stamina relate to the actual duties and responsibilities of the presidency?\n**USEFUL**: This question examines the relevance of Trump's emphasis on stamina to the actual demands of the presidency, which is essential for evaluating the strength of his argument.\n\n4. Is this a relevant factor in evaluating a candidate's fitness for office?\n**USEFUL**: Similar to question 3, this question assesses the relevance of stamina as a factor in evaluating a candidate's fitness for office.\n\n5. What evidence does Trump provide to support his assertion that Hillary's experience is \"bad experience\"?\n**USEFUL**: This question asks for evidence to support Trump's claim, which is essential for evaluating the validity of his argument.\n\n6. Is this a fair characterization of her diplomatic efforts?\n**USEFUL**: This question questions the fairness of Trump's characterization of Hillary's diplomatic efforts, which is crucial for evaluating the strength of his argument.\n\n7.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history\nYou are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history\nYou are going to drive business out\nYour regulations are a disaster , and you 're going to increase regulations all over the place\nmy tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan\nI 'm very proud of it\nIt will create tremendous numbers of new jobs\nyou are going to regulate these businesses out of existence\nWhen I go around—Lester , I tell you this , I 've been all over\nwhen I go around , despite the tax cut , the thing—the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I 'm cutting regulation\nYou have regulations on top of regulations\nnew companies can not form and old companies are going out of business\nyou want to increase the regulations and make them even worse\nI 'm going to cut regulations\nI 'm going to cut taxes big league\nyou 're going to raise taxes big league\nend of story\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"If you help create the profits , you should be able to share in them , not just the executives at the top\nI want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work\nI 've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you 're under\nlet 's have paid family leave , earned sick days\nLet 's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college\nHow are we going to do it\nWe 're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes\nwe tonight are on the stage together , Donald Trump and I\nit 's good to be with you\nWe 're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country\nYou have to judge us , who can shoulder the immense , awesome responsibilities of the presidency , who can put into action the plans that will make your life better\nI hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nCLINTON: \"If you help create the profits , you should be able to share in them , not just the executives at the top\nI want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work\nI 've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you 're under\nlet 's have paid family leave , earned sick days\nLet 's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college\nHow are we going to do it\nWe 're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes\nwe tonight are on the stage together , Donald Trump and I\nit 's good to be with you\nWe 're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country\nYou have to judge us , who can shoulder the immense , awesome responsibilities of the presidency , who can put into action the plans that will make your life better\nI hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th\"\n\nQuestion:\n1.

How does Clinton plan to ensure that the wealthy will indeed pay their fair share, and what specific measures will be taken to close corporate loopholes?\n3. What is the criteria for determining what constitutes a \"fair share\" for the wealthy, and how will this be calculated?\n4. Is there evidence to support the claim that providing paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable child care, and debt-free college will significantly alleviate the stresses faced by working families?\n5. How will Clinton's proposals address the potential unintended consequences, such as increased taxes or economic burdens, on the middle class or small businesses?\n6.

USEFUL: This question challenges the assumption that having the wealthy pay their fair share and closing corporate loopholes will be enough to fund the proposed social programs. It requires critical thinking to evaluate the validity of this assumption.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL: This question is too specific and detailed, and the answer might be too complicated to provide. The text does not provide enough information to answer this question, and it might be more relevant to ask about the general approach or principles behind Clinton's plan.\n\n3. USEFUL: This question challenges the vague term \"fair share\" and requires critical thinking to evaluate how this will be calculated and determined. It is a crucial aspect of Clinton's plan, and clarifying this concept is essential.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question challenges the claim that providing paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable child care, and debt-free college will significantly alleviate the stresses faced by working families. It requires evidence-based reasoning to evaluate the validity of this claim.\n\n5. USEFUL: This question challenges the potential unintended consequences of Clinton's proposals, such as increased taxes or economic burdens, on the middle class or small businesses. It requires critical thinking to evaluate the potential risks and trade-offs of these proposals.\n\n6. USEFUL: This question challenges the lack of specific metrics or benchmarks to measure the success of these proposals. It requires critical thinking to evaluate how the effectiveness of these proposals will be evaluated and what criteria will be used to determine their success.\n\nIn general, questions 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are useful because they challenge assumptions, vague terms, and claims made in the text, and require critical thinking to evaluate the validity of Clinton's proposals.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"FoodAllergyMom: \"My child is 2 years old and he is severely allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, egg and milk.\nMy son has reacted to airborne particles from someone opening a bag of nuts near him.\nMy husband and I used to be world traveler's and dreamed of traveling with our son.\nIt is heartbreaking to think that our child will not get to experience the world, or if he does it may cost him his life.\nWhat about when he gets older and his job requires him to fly across the country in a weekend?\nShould he have to risk his life so he can work in his possible future dream job?\nThis is a disability, no question about it.\nWe are talking about being in the air with peanut particles being circulated through the cabin and possible no place to land for hours.\nAn EpiPen only last 15 minutes.\nPeanut allergy is unpredictable.\nThe first reaction could be mild\nand the second could cause your blood pressure to drop like a rocket, your throat to close up and your heart to stop beating.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

Is the assumption that the child's allergies will remain severe and life-threatening throughout his life supported by medical evidence?\n2. Does the text provide sufficient justification for why the child's allergies should be considered a disability, rather than a manageable medical condition?\n3. How does the author's past experience as a world traveler influence her perception of the limitations imposed by her child's allergies, and is this perspective relevant to the argument?\n4. Is the scenario in which the child's job requires him to fly across the country in a weekend a realistic concern, or is it an exaggerated hypothetical?\n5. Does the text accurately represent the risks associated with peanut allergy, or does it rely on worst-case scenarios to make its point?\n6. Is the author's implicit assumption that the airline industry is unwilling or unable to accommodate passengers with severe allergies supported by evidence or industry practices?\n\nANSWER:",

USEFUL: This question challenges the assumption that the child's allergies will remain severe and life-threatening throughout his life, which is a crucial aspect of the author's argument. It requires the reader to consider the medical evidence and the potential for the child's allergies to change over time.\n\n2. USEFUL: This question questions the author's assertion that the child's allergies should be considered a disability, rather than a manageable medical condition. It encourages the reader to think critically about the definition of a disability and whether the author's argument meets that standard.\n\n3. UNHELPFUL: While the author's past experience as a world traveler may influence her perception of the limitations imposed by her child's allergies, this question is not directly relevant to the argument.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"Secretary Clinton and others , politicians , should have been doing this for years , not right now\nwe 've created a movement\nThey should have been doing this for years\nWhat 's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look , we owe $ 20 trillion\nWe can not do it any longer , Lester\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

What is the basis for Trump's claim that politicians should have been addressing the issue of jobs and the economy for years, and is this a valid criticism of Secretary Clinton?\n2. Is the creation of a movement, as claimed by Trump, a sufficient solution to the problems he mentions, such as the national debt and job losses?\n3. How does Trump's statement about owing $20 trillion relate to his argument about jobs and the economy, and is this connection logical?\n4. What evidence does Trump provide to support his claim that the country can no longer continue on its current economic path, and is this evidence convincing?\n5. Is Trump's criticism of Secretary Clinton and other politicians for not addressing these issues earlier a fair one, given the complexities of economic policy and the role of various factors in shaping the economy?\n6.

What specific economic policies or actions does Trump propose to address the national debt and job losses, and how do these proposals differ from or build upon existing policies implemented by Secretary Clinton and other politicians?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more specific and targeted, asking for concrete policy proposals from Trump and comparing them to existing policies. This encourages critical thinking about the effectiveness of Trump's approach and its relationship to previous efforts.\n\n**Rank 2:**\n2. How does Trump's emphasis on the national debt and economic problems overlook or intersect with other factors that may have contributed to the current state of the economy, such as globalization, technological changes, or income inequality?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more focused on exploring the potential oversights or intersections in Trump's argument, encouraging critical thinking about the complexity of economic issues and the implications of Trump's emphasis.\n\n**Rank 3:**\n3. What evidence or data does Trump provide to support his claim that the country can no longer continue on its current economic path, and how does this evidence account for or dismiss alternative perspectives on the economy?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more specific about the type of evidence required to support Trump's claim, and asks for an evaluation of how this evidence engages with alternative perspectives. This encourages critical thinking about the convincingness of Trump's argument.\n\n**Rank 4:**\n4. In what ways does Trump's creation of a movement address or fail to address the structural or systemic issues contributing to job losses and economic problems, and what alternative solutions might be more effective in addressing these issues?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more targeted at evaluating the effectiveness of Trump's proposed solution, asking for an analysis of how it addresses or fails to address underlying issues. This encourages critical thinking about the sufficiency of Trump's approach.\n\n**Rank 5:**\n5. What are the logical connections or disconnects between Trump's statement about owing $20 trillion and his argument about jobs and the economy, and how do these connections or disconnects impact the coherence of his overall argument?\n\n**Improvement:** This revised question is more focused on evaluating the logical connections in Trump's argument, asking for an analysis of how his statements about the national debt relate to his broader economic claims. This encourages critical thinking about the coherence of Trump's argument.\n\n**Rank 6:**\n6.
