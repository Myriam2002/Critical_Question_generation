    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nMT: \"Claire’s absolutely right about that\nBut then the problem is that that form of capitalism wasn’t generating sufficient surpluses\nAnd so therefore where did the money flow\nIt didn’t flow into those industrial activities\n because in the developed world that wasn’t making enough money\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What is the evidence that the form of capitalism mentioned was not generating sufficient surpluses, and is this a universally accepted fact?\n2. Is the assumption that the money flow is solely driven by profit margins in industrial activities a valid one, and are there other factors at play?\n3.

The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\ncd38: \"The return flight is 6 ½ hours (plus commute time to the airport);\nwhen time allows, I make something to bring on the flight,\nbut if my mother is having a bad day, that's not always possible.\nOn a recent trip, I didn't have time to eat anything at all the day I flew home; got stuck in traffic and barely made my flight (I was the last one on) so didn't have time to eat or buy anything at the airport; and as we started to taxi, the flight crew announced that we had a nut allergy on board, and that they (JB) would not be serving cashews and requested that we not eat any nuts we may have brought on board.\n6 ½ hours feels pretty long at that point!\nNo, it didn't kill me,\nbut it does seem that if JB hadn't served cashews, the risks involved in one or two people eating nuts they may have brought with them would have been extremely, extremely small....\nand, NOTHING in life is riskfree.\nI understand that people want to minimize the risks for their loved ones,\nbut you cannot eliminate the risk completely, regardless of what legislation you put in place.\nIf I ate peanuts at the airport, didn't wash my hands, and then opened the rest room door on the plane immediately before a peanut allergy sufferer, that person could suffer a reaction.\nI can support airlines not serving peanuts/peanut products,\nthereby eliminating the most likely possible cause of a peanutrelated incident on a flight;\nbut not restrictions on what people may choose to eat.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the assumption that the risk of an allergic reaction from a passenger eating nuts they brought on board is extremely small supported by any evidence or expert opinion?\n2. Does the author's personal experience of surviving a 6 ½ hour flight without eating provide sufficient grounds for dismissing the concerns of passengers with severe nut allergies?\n3. Is the comparison between eating peanuts at the airport and not washing hands before opening the restroom door on the plane a valid analogy for the risks associated with allowing passengers to eat nuts on board?\n4. Can the author's claim that \"NOTHING in life is risk-free\" be used to justify not taking any measures to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction on a flight, or is this a false dichotomy?\n5. Is the author's support for airlines not serving peanuts/peanut products inconsistent with their opposition to restrictions on what people may choose to eat, and if so, how can this inconsistency be resolved?\n6. Does the author's assertion that legislation cannot completely eliminate the risk of an allergic reaction on a flight necessarily mean that no efforts should be made to reduce this risk, or is this a non sequitur?\n\nANSWER:",

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

What is the relevance of the endorsements from admirals, generals, ICE, and Border Patrol agents to Trump's qualifications for leading the country, and do these endorsements necessarily translate to effective leadership?\n2. How does Trump's dismissal of 'political hacks' address the actual criticisms or policy proposals made by Secretary Clinton, and does this dismissal constitute a valid counterargument?\n3. Is Trump's claim that the country is in a 'mess' a sufficient justification for his candidacy, and what specific policies or actions does he propose to address this perceived mess?\n4. What is the basis for Trump's skepticism about Russia's involvement in the DNC hack, and does his uncertainty on this issue undermine his ability to address cybersecurity concerns?\n5. Does Trump's agreement with 'parts of what Secretary Clinton said' on cybersecurity indicate a willingness to engage in bipartisan cooperation, or is this statement an attempt to deflect criticism?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content.

You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1.

Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nAngelComa: \"Funny, I thought he did good\nThey get timed responses\nhis plan is all there\nHe can't talk about everything in the plan\nMust be how used you are to politicians saying things and not having a plan\"\n < this message is answering to > \nPunchee: \"That was a weird moment in American debate history. \"Yo check my website. Shit's on there.\"\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the assumption that having a plan is sufficient to justify a politician's performance during a debate valid?\n2. Does the fact that politicians often make promises without a plan necessarily make AngelComa's argument more credible?\n3. Is it reasonable to expect a politician to discuss every aspect of their plan during a debate, or is AngelComa's defense of the politician's performance overly generous?\n4. Can the existence of a plan on a website be considered a sufficient substitute for a clear and concise explanation of that plan during a debate?\n5. Does AngelComa's dismissal of Punchee's criticism as being due to overexposure to empty political promises address the substance of Punchee's concern?\n6. Is AngelComa's response an example of deflecting criticism rather than addressing the issue at hand, and does this undermine the validity of their argument?\n\nANSWER:",

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nTRUMP: \"our country 's a mess\nit 's one thing to have $ 20 trillion in debt\nOur airports are like from a third world country\nYou land at LaGuardia , you land at Kennedy , you land at LAX , you land at Newark , and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible—you come in from China , you see these incredible airports\nwe 've become a third world country\nour bridges are good\neverything 's in great shape\nour airports\nthe worst of all things has happened\nWe owe $ 20 trillion\nwe 're a mess\nWe have n't even started\nwe 've spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East\naccording to a report that I just saw\nWhether it 's 6 or 5\n it looks like it 's 6\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice\nit 's really a shame\nit 's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem\nOur country has tremendous problems\nWe 're a debtor nation\nWe 're a serious debtor nation\nwe have a country that needs new roads , new tunnels , new bridges , new airports , new schools , new hospitals\nwe don't have the money\nit 's been squandered on so many of your ideas\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the comparison between US airports and those in Dubai, Qatar, and China a fair and relevant measure of a country's overall economic health?\n2. Does the mention of a specific report stating $6 trillion spent in the Middle East add credibility to Trump's argument, and is this figure verifiable?\n3. How does Trump's claim that the country could have been rebuilt twice with the $6 trillion spent in the Middle East account for the complexities of infrastructure development and the allocation of funds?\n4. Is Trump's assertion that politicians like Secretary Clinton are solely responsible for the country's debt and infrastructure problems an oversimplification of the issues?\n5.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\ncitizen-s: \"DOT's objective in setting this rule should be to ELIMINATE all bumping, not merely achieve some (unspecified) reduction.\nRegardless of how many caveats an airline might state in its contract terms, passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat.\nBumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity, like so many other aspects of airline behavior.\nFrom that objective, it follows that there should be NO cap on compensation\nand that the financial penalty to the airline should be strong enough to prevent bumping, not just keep it at some arbitrarily \"acceptable\" level.\nThe 100% of the total ticket price for expected arrival within 2 hours later is reasonable.\nCompensation for a longer delay should be the GREATER of 200% of the total ticket cost or the passenger's demonstrable outofpocket costs resulting from the delay\n(a) including any higher priced air ticket from the same or another carrier at the same class, and lodging, meals and incidentals at average prevailing prices in that metro area,\nand (b) with the obligation on the passenger to minimize those costs by arranging, with good faith help from the airline, an alternate flight or other means to get him or her to the destination as soon as reasonably practical.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the assumption that bumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity an oversimplification of the complexities of airline operations?\n2. Does the text provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat, or is this an unsubstantiated assertion?\n3. How does the author justify the specific compensation amounts proposed, such as 100% of the total ticket price for a 2-hour delay, and are these amounts arbitrary or based on empirical data?\n4. Is the proposal to make the airline financially responsible for the passenger's demonstrable out-of-pocket costs resulting from the delay, including higher-priced air tickets and lodging, a reasonable and feasible solution?\n5. Does the text adequately address potential unintended consequences of implementing a no-cap compensation policy, such as increased ticket prices or reduced airline services?\n6. Can the objective of eliminating all bumping be realistically achieved through financial penalties alone, or are there other factors at play that the text overlooks?\n\nANSWER:",

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content.

You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company.

Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"Antanagoge: \"The airline industry can not be left to selfmonitor this.\nStudies have shown that the quality of information from airline customer service department is highly variable and, in some cases, incomplete or inaccurate.\nThe psychological effects of this, combined with the risk of death, are significant.\nStories told by families of vacations never taken, of midair retraction of the promise by the airline that peanuts would not be served, of public humiliation of peanutallergic individuals and their family by airline staff, and of serious reactions in flight, abound.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nAntanagoge: \"The airline industry can not be left to selfmonitor this.\nStudies have shown that the quality of information from airline customer service department is highly variable and, in some cases, incomplete or inaccurate.\nThe psychological effects of this, combined with the risk of death, are significant.\nStories told by families of vacations never taken, of midair retraction of the promise by the airline that peanuts would not be served, of public humiliation of peanutallergic individuals and their family by airline staff, and of serious reactions in flight, abound.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What is the relevance of the variability in customer service information to the argument that the airline industry cannot be left to self-monitor, and how does this variability directly impact the safety of peanut-allergic individuals?\n2. How do the psychological effects of incomplete or inaccurate information from airline customer service departments specifically relate to the risk of death, and is this connection sufficiently substantiated?\n3. What is the basis for assuming that the airline industry's self-monitoring would lead to an increase in the risk of death, and is this assumption supported by the provided anecdotes?\n4. Can the stories told by families of peanut-allergic individuals be considered representative of the entire airline industry, or are they isolated incidents that do not warrant industry-wide regulation?\n5. How does the public humiliation of peanut-allergic individuals and their families by airline staff directly relate to the need for external monitoring of the airline industry, and is this a relevant factor in the argument?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated?

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nJavier: \"I have no problem requiring the airlines to give notification of any \"known\" delays within 30 minutes of when they become aware of it.\nBUT, being a frequent traveler, I see all sorts of problems which are unavoidable and for which the airlines will be blamed by giving such notice with the intend that some flyers may be able to delay thier trip to the airport or even the departure gate.\nI know that many times the airlines can't also know exactly when a weather hold or a maintenance issue will be rectified and that the flight is then ready to go.\nMany time it can be surprisingly faster than expected.\nThe problem is that some flyers may then  wait before going to the airport,\nbut then find that the problem was rectified sooner than expected and the flight departed.\nOf course the flyer and the flyers rights organization will then crucify the airlines for such poor planning.\nFlyers need to grow up and quit pouting and blaming everthing on the airlines.\nThey can't have it both ways.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1.

Does Javier's personal experience as a frequent traveler provide sufficient evidence to support his claims about the potential problems with requiring airlines to give notification of delays?\n3. Is it reasonable to expect airlines to provide accurate estimates of delay times, given Javier's acknowledgment that they often can't know exactly when issues will be rectified?\n4. Does Javier's argument that flyers need to \"grow up\" and take responsibility for their own decisions imply that airlines have no responsibility to provide accurate and timely information to their customers?\n5. Is Javier's concern about flyers being left behind due to delayed flights a valid reason to prioritize the interests of airlines over those of passengers?\n6.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

Is the comparison between Hillary Clinton's website and a military strategy valid, and does it accurately reflect the information available on the website?\n2. Does the fact that Clinton's plan to fight ISIS is publicly available on her website necessarily mean that it would be ineffective or compromise national security?\n3. Is the invocation of General Douglas MacArthur's name intended to imply that Clinton's approach is incompatible with sound military strategy, and is this a fair representation of MacArthur's views?\n4. Does the claim that Clinton's plan would raise taxes by $1.3 trillion accurately reflect the content of her website, and is this figure presented in context?\n5. Is the suggestion that Clinton is \"telling the enemy everything you want to do\" a fair characterization of the information available on her website, or is this a misrepresentation of the content?\n6.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nsecretcurse: \"The first debate was already limited to five people\nAccording to the FEC\n171 people have officially declared their candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination with the FEC (sort by party to see the 171 people a bit easier)\nDo you think every single one of the 171 people that have filed the paperwork with the FEC declaring their candidacy deserves their fair shot at expressing themselves at the first debate\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What is the relevance of the number of people who have officially declared their candidacy to the argument about who should be included in the debate?\n2. Is the assumption that every single one of the 171 people who have filed paperwork deserves a fair shot at expressing themselves at the debate a reasonable one?\n3. Does the fact that the FEC has a process for declaring candidacy necessarily imply that all declared candidates should be included in the debate?\n4. Is the comparison between the number of people who have declared candidacy and the number of people allowed in the debate a fair one, given the potential differences in viability and public support?\n5. What is the criteria for determining who deserves a \"fair shot\" at expressing themselves at the debate, and is this criteria reasonable?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"MT: \"I don’t think you just said the opposite of them was neutral\nSo if they're virtues, doesn’t that imply that the opposite of thrift and prudence is immoral?\nBut, hold on\nIsn’t it simply the case that buying a cup of coffee is something which is substantially less demanding than working up a long-term interest rate?\nTherefore isn’t it a reasonable thing for the state to intervene in those cases\nbecause the knowledge is bounded?\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CL: \"Doesn’t it worry you at all that you're taking advantage of people when they are really in no position to negotiate?\nThey have absolutely very little choice except to take the terms that are being offered to them\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

USEFUL\nThe question challenges the assumption behind the idea that people have \"very little choice\" when dealing with the terms being offered, which is a crucial aspect of the speaker's argument. By asking for evidence to support this assumption, the question encourages critical thinking and evaluation of the argument's validity.\n\n2. USEFUL\nThe question seeks to clarify the speaker's definition of \"vulnerable\" and how it relates to their concern about taking advantage of people. This is a useful question because it helps to understand the speaker's perspective and the underlying values that inform their argument.\n\n3. USEFUL\nThe question explores the implication that the terms being offered are inherently unfair or exploitative, which is a key aspect of the speaker's criticism. By asking for the basis of this implication, the question encourages critical evaluation of the argument's logic and evidence.\n\n4. UNHELPFUL\nThe question is related to the text, but it is too broad and open-ended. The speaker's understanding of fair negotiation is not explicitly stated in the text, and exploring this topic might lead to a lengthy and complex discussion that is not directly relevant to the argument at hand.\n\n5. USEFUL\nThe question challenges the speaker's assumption about the factors at play in the situation, specifically whether people are being coerced or manipulated into accepting the terms. This is a useful question because it encourages critical thinking about the argument's underlying assumptions and the potential alternative explanations.\n\n6. INVALID\nThe question is unrelated to the specific argument being made in the text. While it might be an interesting topic to explore in a broader discussion, it does not directly challenge or relate to the speaker's concern about taking advantage of people in a vulnerable position in the context of the given terms.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Carefully analyze each question's strengths and weaknesses based on the intervention and all available feedback.\n2. Revise each question to be clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives.\n3. Avoid vague, obvious, or out-of-scope questions.\n4.

By asking for the basis of this implication, the question encourages critical evaluation of the argument's logic and evidence.\n\n4. UNHELPFUL\nThe question is related to the text, but it is too broad and open-ended. The speaker's understanding of fair negotiation is not explicitly stated in the text, and exploring this topic might lead to a lengthy and complex discussion that is not directly relevant to the argument at hand.\n\n5. USEFUL\nThe question challenges the speaker's assumption about the factors at play in the situation, specifically whether people are being coerced or manipulated into accepting the terms. This is a useful question because it encourages critical thinking about the argument's underlying assumptions and the potential alternative explanations.\n\n6. INVALID\nThe question is unrelated to the specific argument being made in the text.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated?

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nCLINTON: \"I've heard Donald say this at his rallies\nit's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country\nthe vibrancy of the black church\nthe black businesses that employ so many people\nthe opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids\nThere's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up\nwe do always have to make sure we keep people safe\nThere are the right ways of doing it\nthen there are ways that are ineffective\nStop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional\nin part, because it was ineffective\nIt did not do what it needed to do\nI believe in community policing\nin fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991\nProperty crime is down 40 percent\nWe just don't want to see it creep back up\nWe've had 25 years of very good cooperation\nthere were some problems\nsome unintended consequences\nToo many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses\"\n\nQuestion:\n1.

How does Clinton's mention of the vibrancy of the black church and black businesses relate to the issue of policing and crime rates in black communities?\n3. Is Clinton's comparison of current crime rates to those in 1991 a valid measure of the effectiveness of community policing, and what other factors might have contributed to this decline?\n4. What are the \"unintended consequences\" of community policing that Clinton mentions, and how do these consequences impact the overall assessment of this approach?\n5. Can Clinton's support for community policing be reconciled with her acknowledgment that it has led to the incarceration of many young African-American and Latino men for nonviolent offenses?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"kateinhawaii: \"I personally have suffered from peanut allergies for over 40 years.\nIf there are packaged peanuts served on board a flight, it's 100% guaranteed that I will have a reaction from the peanut dust.\nI do not agree with a buffer zone for a couple of reasons.\nFor me, it's the dust in the air.\nSomeone posted that the air circulates peanut dust right out of the air\nbut apparently not quick enough to prevent a life threatening reaction.\nYou know, airlines tried to create nonsmoking zones on airplanes but that didn't work either.\nI have been on flights where nasty (and do I mean NASTY) flight attendants have made sarcastic remarks about me and my allergies especially on one Delta flight.\nNorthwest was great\nbecause they respected their passengers enough to address their concerns\nand prohibited peanuts altogether.\nIt was as much a relief to walk onto one of their flights as it was to walk onto one of the first smoke free flights!\nSmokers use to use the same logic and reasoning to justify smoking on flights as these peanut proponents are using now.\nI flew on many smoking flights and never needed to inject myself so that I could breathe\nI can't say the same for flights with peanuts.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nkateinhawaii: \"I personally have suffered from peanut allergies for over 40 years.\nIf there are packaged peanuts served on board a flight, it's 100% guaranteed that I will have a reaction from the peanut dust.\nI do not agree with a buffer zone for a couple of reasons.\nFor me, it's the dust in the air.\nSomeone posted that the air circulates peanut dust right out of the air\nbut apparently not quick enough to prevent a life threatening reaction.\nYou know, airlines tried to create nonsmoking zones on airplanes but that didn't work either.\nI have been on flights where nasty (and do I mean NASTY) flight attendants have made sarcastic remarks about me and my allergies especially on one Delta flight.\nNorthwest was great\nbecause they respected their passengers enough to address their concerns\nand prohibited peanuts altogether.\nIt was as much a relief to walk onto one of their flights as it was to walk onto one of the first smoke free flights!\nSmokers use to use the same logic and reasoning to justify smoking on flights as these peanut proponents are using now.\nI flew on many smoking flights and never needed to inject myself so that I could breathe\nI can't say the same for flights with peanuts.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1.

Does the author's personal experience with peanut allergies and reactions on flights provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that buffer zones are ineffective?\n3. How does the author's assertion that the air circulation system on planes cannot remove peanut dust quickly enough to prevent a reaction relate to the argument against buffer zones?\n4. Is the author's positive experience with Northwest Airlines' peanut-free policy sufficient to justify a blanket prohibition on peanuts on all flights?\n5. Does the author's anecdotal evidence of encountering rude flight attendants on Delta flights strengthen or weaken the argument against buffer zones?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"I would love to respond\nI got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama\nYou treated him with terrible disrespect\nI watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are\nIt does n't work that way\nYou were after him\nyou were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb , very famous pictures\nI do n't think you can deny that\njust last week , your campaign manager said it was true\nwhen you tried to act holier than thou , it really does n't work\nas far as the lawsuit , yes , when I was very young , I went into my father 's company , had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens , and we , along with many , many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued\nWe settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt\nIt was very easy to do\nI notice you bring that up a lot\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nTRUMP: \"I would love to respond\nI got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama\nYou treated him with terrible disrespect\nI watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are\nIt does n't work that way\nYou were after him\nyou were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb , very famous pictures\nI do n't think you can deny that\njust last week , your campaign manager said it was true\nwhen you tried to act holier than thou , it really does n't work\nas far as the lawsuit , yes , when I was very young , I went into my father 's company , had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens , and we , along with many , many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued\nWe settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt\nIt was very easy to do\nI notice you bring that up a lot\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What is the relevance of Trump's observation of Clinton's debates against Barack Obama to the current discussion, and does it serve as a valid critique of her behavior?\n2. Does Trump's characterization of Clinton's treatment of Obama as \"terrible disrespect\" accurately reflect the tone and content of those debates?\n3. Can Trump's claim that Clinton's campaign sent out pictures of Obama in a certain garb be verified, and what is the significance of this action in the context of the debate?\n4. How does Trump's settlement of the lawsuit with no admission of guilt address the underlying allegations, and does it impact the validity of Clinton's criticism?\n5. Is Trump's assertion that Clinton is trying to \"act holier than thou\" a fair criticism, and does it relate to the specific issues being discussed in the debate?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

How does the author's comparison of bumping passengers to increasing ticket prices after purchase accurately reflect the situation, and is this analogy valid?\n4. What specific \"hidden extra costs\" does the author refer to when a passenger is bumped, and are these costs quantifiable?\n5. Is the author's assertion that airlines are treating passengers as if they have nothing better to do but wait around in airports supported by empirical evidence or anecdotal experience?\n6.

USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"dberger: \"Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts\nbut all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts\nand will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.\nSo you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away\nand the airlines will do nothing to help you.\nAgain all nuts should be banned from airplanes unless it is your own private plane  then go ahead and eat what you want.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\ndberger: \"Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts\nbut all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts\nand will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.\nSo you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away\nand the airlines will do nothing to help you.\nAgain all nuts should be banned from airplanes unless it is your own private plane  then go ahead and eat what you want.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What is the basis for the claim that all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts, and is this a universal policy across all airlines?\n2. Is the scenario presented, where a person can eat peanuts on a \"nut-free\" flight, a realistic representation of airline policies and practices?\n3. Does the author provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that airlines will \"do nothing\" to help a passenger with a nut allergy in this situation?\n4. Is the proposed solution of banning all nuts from airplanes a reasonable and feasible measure, considering the logistical challenges of enforcing such a ban?\n5. How does the author's suggestion that individuals with private planes can \"eat what they want\" relate to the broader issue of nut allergies on commercial flights?\n6. Does the text adequately address potential counterarguments or alternative solutions to the proposed ban on nuts on airplanes?\n\nANSWER:",

While the feasibility of the proposed ban is an important consideration, it is not a crucial aspect of the author's argument.\n\n5. INVALID\nThe question is unrelated to the main argument of the text, which is about the safety of passengers with nut allergies on commercial flights. The author's suggestion about private planes is a tangential comment that does not affect the validity of the argument.\n\n6. INVALID\nThe question is too vague and could be applied to any text.

Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford?

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible?

USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit\nwhen I look at what you have proposed , you have what is called now the Trump loophole\nit would so advantage you and the business you do\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"nine million people lost their jobs\nFive million people lost their homes\n$ 13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out\nNow , we have come back from that abyss\nit has not been easy\nwe 're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy\nthe last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place\nIndependent experts have looked at what I 've proposed\nlooked at what Donald 's proposed\nI intend to get it done\nTake clean energy\nSome country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century\nDonald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese\nI think it 's real\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"Let 's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald\nfirst , NATO\nNATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5\nyou know the only time it 's ever been invoked ?\nAfter 9/11 , when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism\nsomething that they still are doing by our side\nWith respect to Iran , when I became secretary of state , Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb\nThey had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration\nThey had built covert facilities\nThey had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away\nwe had sanctioned them\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nCLINTON: \"Let 's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald\nfirst , NATO\nNATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5\nyou know the only time it 's ever been invoked ?\nAfter 9/11 , when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism\nsomething that they still are doing by our side\nWith respect to Iran , when I became secretary of state , Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb\nThey had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration\nThey had built covert facilities\nThey had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away\nwe had sanctioned them\"\n\nQuestion:\n1.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"Melanie: \"Well the State has taken a moral position\nthat position was non-judgmentalism\nand terrible harm it’s done\nIt’s created a lot of victims who now need help themselves, and who sometimes go on to create other victims through crime\n I think they do need help\nbut that help should be very carefully calibrated, to restore the capacity for independence and personal responsibility\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

What is the basis for Melanie's claim that the State's non-judgmentalism has caused harm, and is this assertion supported by evidence?\n2. How does Melanie define \"non-judgmentalism,\" and is her interpretation of this concept accurate in the context of the State's position?\n3. What specific kind of help does Melanie propose for the victims, and how would this help be \"carefully calibrated\" to achieve the desired outcomes?\n4. Is Melanie's emphasis on restoring \"independence and personal responsibility\" a realistic or effective solution for victims who may have been severely impacted by their experiences?\n5. Does Melanie's argument imply that the State's non-judgmentalism is the primary cause of the harm, or are there other factors at play that she is not considering?\n6.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible?

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nCLINTON: \"let 's start the clock again , Lester\nWe 've looked at your tax proposals\nI do n't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you 're referring to that would cause the repatriation , bringing back of money that 's stranded overseas\nI happen to support that\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What is the basis for Clinton's assumption that the tax proposals would not cause repatriation of money stranded overseas?\n2. Is Clinton's support for repatriation of money stranded overseas consistent with her criticism of the tax proposals?\n3. Does Clinton provide evidence to support her claim that the tax proposals do not include changes in corporate tax rates?\n4. What specific changes in corporate tax rates would Clinton propose to achieve repatriation of money stranded overseas?\n5. How does Clinton's statement that she supports repatriation of money stranded overseas relate to her overall stance on the tax proposals?\n6.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"I have much better judgment than she does\nThere 's no question about that\nI also have a much better temperament than she has\nshe spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising\nthey get Madison Avenue into a room\nthey put names\ntemperament , let 's go after\nmy strongest asset , maybe by far , is my temperament\nI have a winning temperament\nI know how to win\nShe does not have a\nWrong\nthere 's a person with a temperament that 's got a problem\nThe AFL-CIO the other day , behind the blue screen , I do n't know who you were talking to , Secretary Clinton , but you were totally out of control\n I do n't know who you were talking to\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

What specific evidence does Trump provide to support his claim that he has a better temperament than Clinton, and is this evidence sufficient to justify his assertion?\n2. How does Trump's definition of a \"winning temperament\" relate to his ability to make sound judgments, and is this connection logically supported?\n3. Is Trump's criticism of Clinton's advertising expenses relevant to the question of who has a better temperament, and does this criticism fairly represent Clinton's character?\n4. What is the basis for Trump's claim that Clinton was \"totally out of control\" during her speech to the AFL-CIO, and is this characterization accurate?\n5. Does Trump's assertion that his temperament is his strongest asset imply that he prioritizes personal qualities over policy expertise or experience, and is this prioritization justified?\n6. How does Trump's emphasis on his own temperament and winning abilities address the concerns or needs of his audience, and is this emphasis an effective way to persuade voters?\n\nANSWER:",

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"Doctor-Mom: \"I would support a full ban of peanut products on any airline.\nPeanut reactions can be life threatening.\nAn individual doesn't have to consume the product to have a life threatening reaction.\nThey can have contact or inhalation reactions.\nRestricting to certain flights is not enough,\nas residue can be rampant.\nProviding buffer zones is a thoughtful gesture,\nbut from a practical point of view does not work.\nWith so many food choices available, why are peanuts a necessary choice?\nI am a physician , and author on the subject.\nI have free food allergy online support forums with 3000 members.\nhttp://www.drmomsallergyrx.com/\nI would be more than willing to work with you in any way on this decision making process.\nThe allergic community is so grateful that you are allowing our voices to be heard.\nThe decision you are considering could save many lives.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nDoctor-Mom: \"I would support a full ban of peanut products on any airline.\nPeanut reactions can be life threatening.\nAn individual doesn't have to consume the product to have a life threatening reaction.\nThey can have contact or inhalation reactions.\nRestricting to certain flights is not enough,\nas residue can be rampant.\nProviding buffer zones is a thoughtful gesture,\nbut from a practical point of view does not work.\nWith so many food choices available, why are peanuts a necessary choice?\nI am a physician , and author on the subject.\nI have free food allergy online support forums with 3000 members.\nhttp://www.drmomsallergyrx.com/\nI would be more than willing to work with you in any way on this decision making process.\nThe allergic community is so grateful that you are allowing our voices to be heard.\nThe decision you are considering could save many lives.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1.

Is the comparison between the risk of peanut reactions and the availability of other food choices a valid one, or does it oversimplify the issue?\n4. Can the author's claim that buffer zones are impractical be substantiated by data or is it based on personal opinion?\n5. Is the assertion that a full ban on peanut products is necessary to prevent life-threatening reactions supported by scientific research or is it an overly cautious approach?\n6.

And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\n17th: \"They should get the coverage\nThey are here\nthey work\nthey are a part of this society\nFuck off with your xenophobia\"\n < this message is answering to > \nreaper527: \"now you have a field of democrat presidential candidates supporting it\nrepublicans used to get mocked and laughed at when they said that illegal immigrants would be getting obamacare coverage\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the assumption that all individuals who are physically present in a society and contribute to it through work inherently deserving of coverage a valid basis for policy-making?\n2. Does the message's tone and language, particularly the use of profanity, undermine the credibility of the argument being made?\n3. Is the comparison between the current situation and the past treatment of Republican views on illegal immigrants receiving Obamacare coverage a fair and relevant one?\n4. Does the message provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to support the claim that xenophobia is the primary motivation behind opposition to providing coverage to certain groups?\n5. Is the assertion that being \"a part of this society\" a sufficient condition for receiving coverage, and are there other factors that should be considered?\n6.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nCLINTON: \"I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard\nDonald supported the invasion of Iraq\n...\nThat is absolutely proved over and over again\n...\nHe actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya\nurged that Gadhafi be taken out\nafter actually doing some business with him one time\nlarger point—and he says this constantly—is George W.

How does Clinton's mention of Trump's business dealings with Gadhafi relate to the argument about Trump's support for the invasion of Iraq, and is this connection relevant?\n3.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts.

Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy...

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d.

Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nTRUMP: \"You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history\nYou are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history\nYou are going to drive business out\nYour regulations are a disaster , and you 're going to increase regulations all over the place\nmy tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan\nI 'm very proud of it\nIt will create tremendous numbers of new jobs\nyou are going to regulate these businesses out of existence\nWhen I go around—Lester , I tell you this , I 've been all over\nwhen I go around , despite the tax cut , the thing—the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I 'm cutting regulation\nYou have regulations on top of regulations\nnew companies can not form and old companies are going out of business\nyou want to increase the regulations and make them even worse\nI 'm going to cut regulations\nI 'm going to cut taxes big league\nyou 're going to raise taxes big league\nend of story\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. What is the basis for Trump's claim that his tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan, and is this comparison valid?\n2.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated?

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d.

And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company.

Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt.

How does Clinton plan to ensure that the wealthy will indeed pay their fair share, and what specific measures will be taken to close corporate loopholes?\n3. What is the criteria for determining what constitutes a \"fair share\" for the wealthy, and how will this be measured?\n4. Is it realistic to assume that implementing paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable child care, and debt-free college will be feasible solely through taxing the wealthy and closing corporate loopholes?\n5.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"FoodAllergyMom: \"My child is 2 years old and he is severely allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, egg and milk.\nMy son has reacted to airborne particles from someone opening a bag of nuts near him.\nMy husband and I used to be world traveler's and dreamed of traveling with our son.\nIt is heartbreaking to think that our child will not get to experience the world, or if he does it may cost him his life.\nWhat about when he gets older and his job requires him to fly across the country in a weekend?\nShould he have to risk his life so he can work in his possible future dream job?\nThis is a disability, no question about it.\nWe are talking about being in the air with peanut particles being circulated through the cabin and possible no place to land for hours.\nAn EpiPen only last 15 minutes.\nPeanut allergy is unpredictable.\nThe first reaction could be mild\nand the second could cause your blood pressure to drop like a rocket, your throat to close up and your heart to stop beating.\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID. Provide the label in the following format:\n\nIntervention:\nFoodAllergyMom: \"My child is 2 years old and he is severely allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, egg and milk.\nMy son has reacted to airborne particles from someone opening a bag of nuts near him.\nMy husband and I used to be world traveler's and dreamed of traveling with our son.\nIt is heartbreaking to think that our child will not get to experience the world, or if he does it may cost him his life.\nWhat about when he gets older and his job requires him to fly across the country in a weekend?\nShould he have to risk his life so he can work in his possible future dream job?\nThis is a disability, no question about it.\nWe are talking about being in the air with peanut particles being circulated through the cabin and possible no place to land for hours.\nAn EpiPen only last 15 minutes.\nPeanut allergy is unpredictable.\nThe first reaction could be mild\nand the second could cause your blood pressure to drop like a rocket, your throat to close up and your heart to stop beating.\"\n\nQuestion:\n1. Is the assumption that the child's allergies will remain severe and life-threatening throughout his life supported by medical evidence?\n2. Does the text provide sufficient justification for why the child's allergies should be considered a disability, rather than a manageable medical condition?\n3. How does the author's past experience as a world traveler influence her perception of the limitations imposed by her child's allergies, and is this perspective relevant to the argument?\n4. Is the scenario in which the child's job requires him to fly across the country in a weekend a realistic concern, or is it an exaggerated hypothetical?\n5. Does the text accurately represent the risks associated with peanut allergy, or does it rely on worst-case scenarios to make its point?\n6. Is the EpiPen's 15-minute duration presented as a legitimate concern, or is it being used to create unnecessary alarm about the risks of flying with a peanut allergy?\n\nANSWER:",

USEFUL: This question challenges the assumption that the child's allergies will remain severe and life-threatening throughout his life, which is a crucial aspect of the argument. It requires the reader to consider the medical evidence and whether it supports the author's claims.\n\n2. USEFUL: This question questions the author's assertion that the child's allergies should be considered a disability, rather than a manageable medical condition. It encourages the reader to think critically about the author's justification and whether it is sufficient.\n\n3. UNHELPFUL: While the author's past experience as a world traveler may influence her perception of the limitations imposed by her child's allergies, this question is not directly relevant to the argument. The author's personal experience is not a crucial aspect of the argument, and exploring this topic may not lead to a deeper understanding of the issue.\n\n4. USEFUL: This question challenges the scenario presented by the author, which is used to illustrate the potential risks and limitations imposed by the child's allergies. By questioning whether this scenario is realistic or exaggerated, the reader is encouraged to think critically about the author's argument.\n\n5. USEFUL: This question questions whether the text accurately represents the risks associated with peanut allergy or relies on worst-case scenarios to make its point.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"Secretary Clinton and others , politicians , should have been doing this for years , not right now\nwe 've created a movement\nThey should have been doing this for years\nWhat 's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look , we owe $ 20 trillion\nWe can not do it any longer , Lester\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it. Your task is to classify the question into one of the six categories: USEFUL, UNHELPFUL, or INVALID.

Here is the list of improved questions, ranked from strongest to weakest based on quality and depth:\n\n1. **Revised Question:** What specific policies or actions does Trump propose to address the national debt of $20 trillion, and how do these proposals relate to his argument about jobs and the economy?\n   → **Strengths:** Challenges Trump's argument about the national debt, requires critical thinking to evaluate the connection between debt and economy.\n   → **Score:** 0.85\n\n2. **Revised Question:** How does Trump's claim that politicians like Secretary Clinton should have been addressing the issue of jobs and the economy for years account for the complexities of globalization, technological change, and other structural factors that may have contributed to economic challenges?\n   → **Strengths:** Challenges Trump's assumption about the role of politicians, introduces alternative perspectives on economic challenges.\n   → **Score:** 0.82\n\n3. **Revised Question:** What evidence does Trump provide to support his claim that the creation of a \"movement\" is a sufficient justification for his approach to addressing jobs and the economy, and how does this evidence relate to the specific policy proposals he has made?\n   → **Strengths:** Challenges Trump's assertion about the \"movement\", requires critical thinking to evaluate the sufficiency of evidence.\n   → **Score:** 0.78\n\n4. **Revised Question:** In what ways does Trump's argument about jobs and the economy rely on oversimplification or scapegoating of particular groups or individuals, and how does this impact the validity of his claims?\n   → **Strengths:** Challenges Trump's argument about oversimplification, introduces alternative perspectives on the causes of economic challenges.\n   → **Score:** 0.75\n\n5. **Revised Question:** How does Trump's statement about the national debt of $20 trillion relate to his proposals for job creation and economic growth, and what are the potential risks or unintended consequences of his approach?\n   → **Strengths:** Challenges Trump's argument about debt and economy, introduces alternative perspectives on risks and consequences.\n   → **Score:** 0.72\n\n6. **Revised Question:** What specific steps does Trump propose to take to address the issue of jobs and the economy, and how do these proposals differ from or build upon existing policies and initiatives?\n   → **Strengths:** Challenges Trump's argument about policy proposals, requires critical thinking to evaluate the specificity and effectiveness of proposals.\n   → **Score:** 0.68\n\nI have carefully integrated both ML and LLM feedback to improve the questions, making sure they are open-ended and meaningful for critical analysis. The revised questions are clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives.",
