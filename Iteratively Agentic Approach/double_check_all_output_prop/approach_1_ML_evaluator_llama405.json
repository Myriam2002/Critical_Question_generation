    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2.

To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content.

Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible?

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"CLINTON: \"I've heard Donald say this at his rallies\nit's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country\nthe vibrancy of the black church\nthe black businesses that employ so many people\nthe opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids\nThere's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up\nwe do always have to make sure we keep people safe\nThere are the right ways of doing it\nthen there are ways that are ineffective\nStop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional\nin part, because it was ineffective\nIt did not do what it needed to do\nI believe in community policing\nin fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991\nProperty crime is down 40 percent\nWe just don't want to see it creep back up\nWe've had 25 years of very good cooperation\nthere were some problems\nsome unintended consequences\nToo many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"I would love to respond\nI got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama\nYou treated him with terrible disrespect\nI watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are\nIt does n't work that way\nYou were after him\nyou were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb , very famous pictures\nI do n't think you can deny that\njust last week , your campaign manager said it was true\nwhen you tried to act holier than thou , it really does n't work\nas far as the lawsuit , yes , when I was very young , I went into my father 's company , had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens , and we , along with many , many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued\nWe settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt\nIt was very easy to do\nI notice you bring that up a lot\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented.

Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content.

Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible?

Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible?

Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"17th: \"They should get the coverage\nThey are here\nthey work\nthey are a part of this society\nFuck off with your xenophobia\"\n < this message is answering to > \nreaper527: \"now you have a field of democrat presidential candidates supporting it\nrepublicans used to get mocked and laughed at when they said that illegal immigrants would be getting obamacare coverage\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated?

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate six USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"Secretary Clinton and others , politicians , should have been doing this for years , not right now\nwe 've created a movement\nThey should have been doing this for years\nWhat 's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look , we owe $ 20 trillion\nWe can not do it any longer , Lester\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.
