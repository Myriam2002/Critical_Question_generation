During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d.

    "prompt_generator": "You are a teacher in a critical thinking class. Your goal is to help students learn to critically evaluate argumentative texts. To do this, you need to generate critical questions that challenge the validity of the arguments presented. A question is considered USEFUL if it makes the reader reflect on the text in a way that could potentially diminish its perceived validity. Avoid questions that are common sense, reading-comprehension, too general, or that introduce new concepts not present in the text.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - Challenges the textâ€™s argument in a meaningful way.\n   - Prompts critical reflection that can weaken the argumentâ€™s validity if answered.\n   - Focuses on details already present in the text without introducing external ideas.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - Although related to the text, it asks about aspects that are either common sense, well-known facts, or too complicated.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - Unrelated to the text or introduces new concepts.\n   - Uses vague language or fails to challenge the argumentâ€™s core reasoning.\n\nFew-Shot Examples:\n\nExample 1\nTEXT:\n\"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy... There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge.\"\n\nUseful Questions:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is there evidence that prevents misleading descriptions of fatty products, and does the text support this claim?\n- Does the credit card companyâ€™s offer of 0% interest truly reflect the cost of borrowing, given the hidden fees?\n\nUnhelpful Question:\n- How does the speaker know that the advertisement is irresponsible? (This is already stated in the text.)\n\nInvalid Question:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated? (Too generic.)\n\nNow, using the guidelines and examples above, generate three USEFUL critical questions for the following text:\n\nTEXT:\n\"TRUMP: \"I do want to say that I was just endorsed\nand more are coming next week\nit will be over 200 admirals\nmany of them here—admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country\nThat just happened\nmany more are coming\nI was just endorsed by ICE\nThey 've never endorsed anybody before on immigration\nI was just recently endorsed—16,500 Border Patrol agents\nwhen Secretary Clinton talks about this , I mean , I 'll take the admirals and I 'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge\nlook at the mess that we 're in\nAs far as the cyber , I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said\nWe should be better than anybody else\nperhaps we 're not\nI do n't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC\"\"\n\nProvide one question per line.

    "prompt_evaluator": "In this assignment, you should imagine that you are a teacher in a class on critical thinking. During this class, your goal is to get students to critically analyze the argumentative texts presented to them and provide them with the tools to evaluate the validity of the arguments in the text. To achieve this goal, students will be given a paragraph with argumentative content, and you should pose questions to them about this paragraph. You should read the paragraph, look at the questions we suggest, and then assess which of these questions might be useful to the students and which ones might not. For each of the questions, you will have to decide if it is useful, unhelpful, or not even valid for the arguments of that paragraph. Here we define these categories:\n\nGuidelines:\n\n1. USEFUL QUESTION:\n   - One should not take the arguments in the text as valid without having reflected on this question.\n\n2. UNHELPFUL QUESTION:\n   - The question makes sense and is related to the text but is unlikely to be useful for critical analysis.\n   - The answer to the question might be common sense or a well-known fact that does not generate controversy.\n   - The question might be too complex to be practical or is already answered in the text.\n\n3. INVALID QUESTION:\n   - The answer to this question cannot serve to invalidate or diminish the acceptability of the arguments in the text.\n   - This may happen if:\n     a. The question is unrelated to the text.\n     b. The question introduces new concepts that were not in the text.\n     c. The question does not challenge any argument in the text.\n     d. The question is too vague and could be applied to any text.\n     e. The question is a reading-comprehension question rather than a critical-thinking question.\n\nBelow are examples of texts along with categorized questions:\n\nExample 1:\n\nTEXT:\nMT: \"We have indeed required those products to have very large warnings on them, telling people about their salt and fat content. And we don't allow them to say things which are misleading. We don't allow fatty products to say they're healthy. I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company. There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers. Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you'll be paying all sorts of charges. And then very, very quickly you'll be lured into paying a very large charge. Do you think it's responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that? I've got all the information there in front of me.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What is the basis for comparing the credit card company's advertisement to food products, and is this comparison valid?\n- Is it actually the case that fatty products that have potential bad consequences are not allowed to be described in misleading ways? Is there evidence for this claim?\n- Are there other factors in this particular case that could have interfered with the event of 'people being lured into paying a very large charge'?\n- Does the credit card company's offer of 0% interest rates for new balances and transfers accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing? What hidden fees or charges might consumers face?\n- How does the mentioned credit card offer differ between its initial presentation and fine print details?\n- What specific charges does the credit card company advertise as being 0% per annum, and how do these charges compare to the charges that will actually be paid?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- How does the speaker know that the credit card company's advertisement is irresponsible, and what evidence does the speaker have to support this claim? â†’ it says it in the text.\n- How might the credit card company's advertisement be improved to make it more responsible and less misleading, and what changes would need to be made to achieve this? â†’ answering this is very complicated and not to the point.\n- How strong is the generalization that if all sorts of charges are written in small print then people will be lured into paying a very large charge? â†’ to some extent, this is common sense.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- Are there any assumptions made by the speaker that are not explicitly stated but are implied by their argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n- Are these measures effective in preventing misleading claims by manufacturers? â†’ no measures are being proposed in this text.\n- Is the speaker's argument based on a logical chain of reasoning, or are there any gaping holes or flaws in the argument? â†’ this question could be raised for any text, itâ€™s not specific.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTEXT:\nJW: \"Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt. Sometimes it's a good idea, and sometimes it's a bad idea. And so I think there's been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far. The question is why is there too much debt? Why are people taking on too much debt? Now, a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt, which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it's the bankers who aren't going to get repaid. So it's a very odd idea. There's too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep.\"\n\nUSEFUL QUESTIONS:\n- If debt is considered 'morally neutral', then how do we determine whether someone's level of debt is acceptable or not? Are there specific circumstances under which debt becomes immoral or irresponsible?\n- What is being defined as 'too much debt'?\n- How does the concept of 'excessive debt' differ from simply having debt? In other words, at what point does debt become problematic?\n- How does the comparison to unmarried mothers and overproduction of sheep relate to the issue of debt?\n\nUNHELPFUL QUESTIONS:\n- What evidence supports that it is generally accepted that debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n- What are the potential consequences of labeling debt as 'good' or 'bad'? â†’ this question is too complicated to answer.\n\nINVALID QUESTIONS:\n- How does JW suggest we approach understanding why there is too much debt in society? Does he offer any alternative perspectives beyond those already discussed in the conversation? â†’ this is a reading-comprehension question.\n- Why might banks encourage people to take on more debt than they can afford? Are they acting in their own self-interest, or are there broader societal forces at play here? â†’ the text does not say that banks encourage people to take more debt.\n\nYour task is to classify each suggested question as useful, unhelpful, or invalid, and provide a brief justification for your classification.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEvaluation Task:\n\nNow, based on the guidelines above, you will be given an intervention (a paragraph from an argumentative text) and a question that attempts to challenge it.

It requires critical thinking to evaluate the connection between these endorsements and Trump's leadership abilities.\n\n2. USEFUL: This question further challenges the assumption that endorsements necessarily translate to effective leadership. It encourages critical thinking about the relationship between endorsements and leadership abilities.\n\n3. USEFUL: This question highlights Trump's dismissal of 'political hacks' and encourages critical thinking about whether this dismissal addresses the actual criticisms or policy proposals made by Secretary Clinton. It challenges the assumption that Trump's dismissal is a valid counterargument.\n\n4. UNHELPFUL: This question is related to the previous one, but it is more focused on the definition of a valid counterargument. While it is a relevant question, it is more of a semantic debate and might not be as useful for critical analysis.\n\n5. USEFUL: This question challenges Trump's skepticism about Russia's involvement in the DNC hack and encourages critical thinking about whether this skepticism is justified given his agreement with parts of Secretary Clinton's statement on cybersecurity.\n\n6. USEFUL: This question builds on the previous one and challenges Trump's claim to being a strong leader on cybersecurity issues. It encourages critical thinking about whether Trump's skepticism undermines his own leadership claims.\n\nOverall, questions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are classified as USEFUL because they challenge assumptions, encourage critical thinking, and are relevant to the argument presented in the intervention. Question 4 is classified as UNHELPFUL because it is more focused on semantics and might not be as useful for critical analysis.",
    "improved_questions": "After analyzing the original questions, intervention, and evaluator feedback, I've revised each question to improve clarity, specificity, and critical thinking. Here's the list of improved questions, ranked from strongest to weakest:\n\n1. **What specific leadership qualities or policies do the endorsements from admirals, generals, ICE, and Border Patrol agents imply that Trump possesses, and how do these qualities align with the country's needs?**\n\t* Score: 0.85\n\t* This revised question builds on the original, challenging the assumption that endorsements automatically translate to effective leadership. It encourages critical thinking about the connection between endorsements and Trump's leadership abilities.\n2. **How does Trump's skepticism about Russia's involvement in the DNC hack align with his agreement on parts of Secretary Clinton's statement on cybersecurity, and what implications does this have for his leadership on this issue?**\n\t* Score: 0.78\n\t* This revised question combines elements of the original questions 2 and 4, making it more comprehensive and challenging. It encourages critical thinking about Trump's stance on cybersecurity and its impact on his leadership claims.\n3. **In what ways do Trump's dismissals of 'political hacks' address or fail to address the actual criticisms or policy proposals made by Secretary Clinton, and what does this reveal about his approach to counterarguments?**\n\t* Score: 0.72\n\t* This revised question builds on the original, highlighting Trump's dismissal of 'political hacks' and encouraging critical thinking about its validity as a counterargument.\n4. **What are the potential risks or limitations of relying on endorsements from admirals, generals, ICE, and Border Patrol agents as evidence of Trump's leadership abilities, and how might these endorsements be balanced with other forms of evaluation?**\n\t* Score: 0.65\n\t* This revised question introduces a new perspective, encouraging critical thinking about the potential risks and limitations of relying on endorsements as evidence of leadership abilities.\n5. **How does Trump's emphasis on endorsements from law enforcement and military organizations relate to his overall vision for the country's leadership, and what does this reveal about his priorities and values?**\n\t* Score: 0.58\n\t* This revised question provides a new angle, exploring the connection between Trump's emphasis on endorsements and his broader leadership vision.\n6. **What would be the implications of Trump's skepticism about Russia's involvement in the DNC hack for his administration's approach to cybersecurity and international relations?**\n\t* Score: 0.45\n\t* This revised question, while still relevant, is more speculative and less directly connected to the intervention. It encourages critical thinking about potential implications but is less effective at challenging assumptions.\n\nThe revised questions aim to be clearer, more specific, and better at challenging key assumptions, exploring risks, or proposing alternative perspectives. They integrate both ML and LLM feedback, ensuring improvements in quality and depth.",
