Questions should avoid introducing new concepts or being overly general.\n\n1. The text mentions that violent crime has decreased significantly since 1991. However, does the data show a direct correlation between the reduction in crime rates and the implementation of community policing?\n2. While Clinton acknowledges \"unintended consequences\" of certain policies, specifically mentioning young African-American and Latino men ending up in jail for non-violent offenses, how does she propose to address these issues while maintaining public safety?\n3. Clinton criticizes the ineffectiveness of stop-and-frisk based on its unconstitutionality and lack of results. Can she provide evidence that community policing has been equally effective in reducing crime rates as compared to other strategies?\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nDoes the data show a direct correlation between the reduction in crime rates and the implementation of community policing?\nHow does she propose to address these issues while maintaining public safety?\nCan she provide evidence that community policing has been equally effective in reducing crime rates as compared to other strategies?\n</answer>",
