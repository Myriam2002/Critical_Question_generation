        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three USEFUL critical questions for the given text. The text is from MT, who says that Claire is right, but the problem was that form of capitalism didn't generate enough surpluses, so money didn't flow into industrial activities in the developed world because it wasn't making enough money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the argument here. The main claim seems to be that a certain form of capitalism failed to generate sufficient surpluses, leading to money not flowing into industrial activities in the developed world. The reasoning is that because there wasn't enough profit, the capital went elsewhere.\n\nNow, to create useful questions that challenge the validity. Let's break it down. \n\nThe first part: \"Claire\u2019s absolutely right about that.\" But the text doesn't specify what Claire said. So a question could ask about the basis for agreeing with Claire without knowing her point. That's a gap in the argument.\n\nNext, MT says capitalism wasn't generating enough surpluses. A useful question could challenge the assumption that surplus generation is the main reason money flows to certain sectors. Maybe other factors are at play.\n\nThen, the statement that money didn't flow into industrial activities because they weren't making enough money. This assumes that profitability is the only factor. A question could challenge that by asking if there are other reasons besides profitability that influence investment decisions.\n\nAlso, MT mentions the developed world specifically. Why is the developed world singled out? Is there a comparison with the developing world? That's another angle.\n\nPutting this together, possible questions:\n\n1. What specific criteria or evidence is used to determine that the form of capitalism in question wasn't generating \"sufficient surpluses\"? This questions the basis for the claim about surpluses.\n\n2. How does the argument establish a direct causal link between insufficient surpluses and the lack of monetary flow into industrial activities? This challenges the causality aspect.\n\n3. Are there factors other than profitability that could explain why money didn't flow into industrial activities in the developed world? This introduces doubt by suggesting other variables.\n\nI need to ensure each question is specific to the text, doesn't introduce new concepts, and challenges the argument's validity. Let me check against the guidelines. Each question targets existing elements (surpluses, causality, profitability) and prompts critical evaluation without being too broad. They don't ask for examples or comprehension but push the reader to question the argument's foundations. Looks good."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text. The text is about someone's experience on a flight where they couldn't eat due to a nut allergy announcement, leading to a discussion on airline policies regarding serving nuts and passenger restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main arguments here. The speaker argues that while airlines shouldn't serve peanuts to minimize risk, they shouldn't restrict what passengers bring. They believe you can't eliminate all risks, and the measures taken (like not serving cashews) might be overkill since the remaining risks are extremely small. The key points are: risk can't be eliminated completely, serving nuts is the main risk, and personal choice shouldn't be restricted beyond that.\n\nNow, to form useful questions that challenge the validity. Useful questions should focus on existing details without introducing new concepts. Let's see:\n\n1. The speaker compares the risk of passengers eating their own nuts to not serving cashews. Maybe question the validity of that comparison. Like, is the risk truly the same if the airline serves nuts versus passengers bringing them? Are there factors that make one scenario riskier?\n\n2. The speaker mentions that even without serving cashews, there's still a risk from passengers' own nuts. But they argue that these risks are extremely small. Is there evidence provided for that claim? The text doesn't cite any studies or data, so questioning the basis of that risk assessment could be useful.\n\n3. The argument that \"nothing in life is risk-free\" is used to justify not imposing restrictions. But does that reasoning hold? If some risks can be mitigated (like not serving nuts), does the general statement about unavoidable risks undermine the need for any precautions?\n\nAnother angle: The speaker had a personal experience where they couldn't eat for 6.5 hours. They use this to argue against restrictions. But is their individual experience sufficient to generalize about policy? Maybe question whether personal anecdotes are a strong basis for broader regulations.\n\nAlso, the speaker supports airlines not serving peanuts but opposes restrictions on passengers. Is there a contradiction here? If serving peanuts is a major risk, why is allowing passengers to bring them acceptable? The reasoning might need scrutiny.\n\nWait, the text says \"I can support airlines not serving peanuts... but not restrictions on what people may choose to eat.\" So the distinction is between airline service and passenger choice. A useful question could challenge whether this distinction is valid. For example, does allowing passengers to bring nuts negate the benefit of the airline not serving them?\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Does the comparison between the risk posed by the airline serving cashews and passengers bringing their own nuts account for differences in quantity or likelihood of exposure? (Challenges the validity of equating the two risks)\n\n2. What evidence supports the claim that the risks from passengers consuming their own nuts would be \"extremely, extremely small\" if the airline doesn't serve them? (Questions the basis of the risk assessment)\n\n3. If airlines refrain from serving peanuts to minimize risk, how does allowing passengers to bring their own nuts not reintroduce a similar level of risk, thereby undermining the initial precaution? (Challenges the distinction between serving and bringing nuts)\n\nThese questions target the core arguments, challenge assumptions, and don't introduce new concepts. They make the reader reflect on the validity of the reasoning presented."

Let me start by reading the text carefully to understand the arguments presented.\n\nTrump mentions being endorsed by over 200 admirals and generals, ICE, and 16,500 Border Patrol agents. He contrasts these endorsements with \"political hacks\" and claims the country is in a mess. He also comments on cyber issues, doubting Russia's involvement in the DNC breach.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main arguments. The primary claims here are the endorsements from military and immigration officials as a qualification for leadership, the criticism of previous leaders as ineffective, and skepticism about Russia's role in the cyber incident.\n\nFor useful questions, they should challenge the validity without introducing new concepts. Let me think:\n\n1. The endorsements by ICE and Border Patrol: ICE never endorsed anyone before. Is there evidence that their endorsement is based on immigration policy expertise? That challenges the relevance of their endorsement.\n\n2. He uses admirals/generals vs. political hacks. Does the number of endorsements directly relate to leadership capability? Maybe it's an appeal to authority, so questioning the assumption that more endorsements mean better leadership.\n\n3. On the cyber issue, he doubts Russia's involvement. The question could ask how his uncertainty about the perpetrator affects his proposed solutions. If he doesn't know who did it, how can he address it effectively?\n\nAlso, check if these questions are specific to the text. They shouldn't be too general or introduce external ideas. Avoid questions about common knowledge or that are too broad.\n\nAnother angle: the link between endorsements and effective leadership. Are there instances where such endorsements didn't translate to good leadership? But that might require external knowledge, so better to focus on the validity of the comparison.\n\nSo possible questions:\n\n- How does the endorsement by ICE and Border Patrol agents specifically validate Trump's qualifications to lead, given their roles in immigration enforcement?\n\n- What evidence supports the assumption that a higher number of military endorsements correlates with better presidential leadership?\n\n- If uncertainty exists regarding Russia's involvement in the DNC breach, how does this affect the credibility of proposed cybersecurity measures?\n\nCheck against the examples. The first two questions challenge the link between endorsements and leadership validity. The third connects his doubt to policy credibility. They don't introduce new concepts, are specific, and target the argument's core."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for Trump's text. The goal is to challenge the argument's validity without introducing new concepts. Let me break down the text first.\n\nTrump's main points are:\n1. The US has $20 trillion in debt, partly due to spending $6 trillion in the Middle East.\n2. Infrastructure (airports, bridges, roads, etc.) is in terrible shape, comparing them to third-world countries.\n3. Politicians like Clinton caused these problems by squandering money on their ideas instead of rebuilding the country.\n\nI need to find questions that target weaknesses in these arguments. Let's look at each part.\n\nFirst, he compares US airports to those in Dubai, Qatar, and China. But is that a fair comparison? Those countries might have newer infrastructure, but does that make the US third-world? Also, he mentions bridges are good, which contradicts the other infrastructure claims. So a question about the inconsistency between bridges being good and other infrastructure being bad could work.\n\nSecond, the $6 trillion spent in the Middle East. He says \"we could have rebuilt our country twice.\" Is that a realistic estimate? Rebuilding infrastructure costs vary, so does $6 trillion actually cover twice the needed amount? Also, he's blaming Clinton's ideas for squandering money, but does the $6 trillion refer to military spending, which might be a different budget than infrastructure? That's an assumption not addressed.\n\nThird, the debt and being a \"serious debtor nation.\" He ties the debt to not having money for infrastructure. But national debt doesn't directly equate to lack of funds for projects. Governments can borrow for investments. So a question challenging the link between debt and inability to fund infrastructure would be good.\n\nAlso, he claims \"everything's in great shape\" except airports and other listed items. Wait, he says bridges are good but then lists needing new bridges. Contradiction? So a question about the inconsistency between bridges being good and needing new ones.\n\nPutting this together, possible questions:\n\n1. How does the assertion that bridges are \"good\" align with the claim that the country needs new bridges, and does this contradiction undermine the overall argument about infrastructure decay?\n\n2. What evidence supports the claim that $6 trillion spent in the Middle East equates to being able to rebuild the country's infrastructure twice, and are there factors that challenge this equivalence?\n\n3. Does the comparison of U.S. airports to those in Dubai, Qatar, and China account for differences in government investment priorities or economic systems, and how does this affect the validity of labeling the U.S. as a \"third world country\"?\n\nWait, the third question might be good, but does it introduce new concepts like government priorities or economic systems? The text mentions other countries' airports but doesn't discuss why theirs are better. So maybe it's okay because the text brings up the comparison, so challenging the basis of that comparison is valid.\n\nAnother angle: the debt being $20 trillion. He links debt to being a mess, but is there a direct causation? Maybe a question about whether the debt level directly causes infrastructure issues or if other factors are involved.\n\nAlternatively, the text blames politicians like Clinton for squandering money on \"your ideas,\" but the $6 trillion in the Middle East\u2014is that part of Clinton's policies? If the spending was on military (e.g., Iraq, Afghanistan), which presidents were involved? Trump's implying Clinton is responsible, but is that accurate? So a question challenging the attribution of responsibility.\n\nSo possible revised questions:\n\n1. How does the claim that U.S. airports are comparable to those in \"third world countries\" account for potential differences in funding mechanisms or priorities between the U.S. and countries like China or Qatar?\n\n2. Is there evidence that the $6 trillion spent in the Middle East could realistically cover the cost of rebuilding U.S. infrastructure twice, and what factors might challenge this assertion?\n\n3. Does the argument that politicians like Secretary Clinton caused the national debt and infrastructure neglect overlook other contributing factors or administrations involved in Middle East spending?\n\nChecking against the guidelines: these should challenge the argument's validity, use existing text details, not introduce new concepts. The first question addresses the comparison, which is in the text. The second questions the $6 trillion claim's validity. The third challenges the blame on Clinton by considering other factors. All are valid, I think. Let me check the examples to ensure alignment.\n\nIn Example 1, questions challenge comparisons and hidden fees. Similarly, here, challenging the airport comparison is like the credit card vs. food products comparison. The second question is about the basis of a financial claim, similar to the 0% interest question. The third is about overlooked factors, which is present in the examples. So these should fit as useful questions."

The key points are: elimination of bumping, treating passengers as more than economic units, and specific compensation structures.\n\nNow, looking for potential weaknesses. The argument assumes that higher penalties will eliminate bumping. But maybe airlines might find other cost-effective ways to handle overbooking despite penalties. Also, comparing passengers to economic units\u2014does the proposed solution actually address that dehumanization? Also, the 100% and 200% figures: are they arbitrary or based on evidence?

Are there scenarios where airlines might still bump passengers despite high penalties?\n2.

So a question challenging that assumption.\n\nI need to check if these questions are present in the examples to avoid duplication. The first example had a question about the comparison validity, so that's good. The second example's question about evidence for claims is also similar. The third about other factors interfering. So maybe the third question here is about the assumption that small print causes people to be lured. That's a solid angle.\n\nI should make sure each question is specific to the text.

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text about the airline industry and their self-monitoring issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the text thoroughly. The main argument here is that the airline industry shouldn't self-monitor because their customer service info is unreliable, leading to psychological effects and risks of death. They mention stories of families affected by issues like peanut allergies on flights.\n\nNow, following the guidelines, the questions should challenge the argument's validity without introducing new concepts. Let me brainstorm possible angles.\n\n1. The text uses anecdotes (stories) to support the claim. A good question might challenge the reliability of these anecdotes as evidence. Like, do these stories represent a widespread issue or are they isolated incidents?\n\n2. The text links psychological effects with the risk of death. Are these two aspects being conflated? The question could ask if the combination is justified or if they're separate issues with different severities.\n\n3. The argument states that quality of information is variable, incomplete, or inaccurate. But does variability necessarily mean it's insufficient? Maybe some airlines do a good job. So a question could ask if variability alone is enough to dismiss self-monitoring.\n\nAlso, checking the examples given in the guidelines. For instance, in example 1, they asked about the validity of comparisons. Here, maybe the use of emotional stories vs. data.\n\nAnother point: the risk of death is mentioned, but how directly is that linked to the quality of information? If the info is bad, does that actually lead to death, or is that a separate risk?\n\nWait, the text says \"psychological effects... combined with the risk of death are significant.\" So combining two things. Are they being conflated? That's a possible question.\n\nAlso, the studies mentioned: do they specifically show a link to the risk of death, or just the variability of information? The question could challenge whether the studies support the claim about death risk.\n\nSo possible questions:\n\n- Does the variability in information quality directly correlate with the risk of death, or are these separate issues that are being conflated?\n\n- Are the anecdotal stories provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate a systemic failure in self-monitoring by airlines?\n\n- How does the combination of psychological effects and risk of death strengthen the argument against self-monitoring, and is this combination justified?\n\nWait, the third one might be a bit leading. Let me rephrase.\n\nMaybe: Is the combination of psychological effects and risk of death in the argument justified, or does it conflate issues of differing severity?\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the studies: Do the cited studies address both the quality of information and the risk of death, or are these claims supported separately?\n\nHmm. Also, the text mentions studies about information quality but then adds the risk of death. Are the studies about death risk too? If not, that's a gap.\n\nSo a question could be: Do the studies cited about variable information quality also address the risk of death, or is this a separate claim without direct evidence?\n\nAnother angle: The argument assumes that self-monitoring is ineffective because information is variable. But maybe some airlines have good systems. So, does the presence of variable quality across the industry necessarily invalidate the entire self-monitoring approach, or could some airlines still effectively self-regulate?\n\nAlso, the term \"abound\" is used for the stories. Are these stories statistically significant or just numerous anecdotes?\n\nPutting it all together, the three best questions would be:\n\n1. Are the anecdotal stories of airline incidents sufficient to establish a systemic failure in self-monitoring, or could they represent isolated cases?\n\n2. Do the studies cited about variable information quality specifically link this variability to the risk of death, or are these two issues presented without direct evidence connecting them?\n\n3. How does the argument justify combining psychological effects with the risk of death as significant factors against self-monitoring, and does this combination conflate differing levels of severity?\n\nI need to make sure each question is focused on the text's details, doesn't introduce new concepts, and challenges the argument's validity. Let me check against the examples. For instance, in example 1, they asked about the validity of comparisons. Here, the combination of psychological effects and death risk is a key point. Also, the use of anecdotes vs. studies. These questions target the core reasoning and evidence in the text."

He mentions that flyers might delay going to the airport, miss their flight if it departs sooner, and then blame the airlines. He concludes that flyers need to grow up and stop blaming the airlines for everything.\n\nNow, following the guidelines, the questions need to challenge the argument's validity by focusing on existing details without introducing new concepts. They should prompt reflection that could weaken Javier's points.\n\nFirst, Javier compares the unpredictability of weather holds and maintenance issues leading to uncertain delay durations. A useful question might question the validity of this comparison. For example, does the unpredictability of resolution times justify withholding notifications? Maybe airlines can provide updates even if the exact resolution time isn't known, so the assumption that they can't inform passengers properly could be challenged.\n\nSecond, Javier says flyers can't have it both ways. The argument seems to present a false dilemma. Are there other ways airlines could communicate delays without causing the issues he mentions? This challenges the assumption that there's only a binary choice between full notification and no notification.\n\nThird, Javier blames flyers and their rights organizations for crucifying airlines. A question could ask if there's evidence that flyers' reactions are the main issue, rather than airlines' communication strategies. This challenges the premise that the problem lies solely with the passengers' behavior.\n\nLet me check if these questions meet the criteria. They focus on existing points, don't introduce new concepts, and challenge the argument's validity. They aren't common sense or too broad.

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for Trump's statement. First, I need to understand the argument he's making.\n\nTrump is criticizing an opponent (probably Clinton) by saying that her plan to fight ISIS, as detailed on her website, is equivalent to telling the enemy everything, which he implies is bad. He compares this to General MacArthur, suggesting that MacArthur wouldn't approve. The core argument seems to be that publicly outlining strategies helps the enemy, hence it's a bad approach.\n\nNow, to generate useful questions that challenge the validity. According to the guidelines, the questions should focus on details present, not introduce new concepts, and prompt reflection that could weaken the argument.\n\nFirst, the comparison to MacArthur. Does Trump provide any evidence that MacArthur's approach aligns with keeping strategies secret? If not, questioning the validity of that comparison would be useful. So something like: \"Is there evidence that General MacArthur opposed publicizing military strategies, and how does this relate to the claim that detailing plans helps the enemy?\"\n\nSecond, Trump equates outlining strategies on a website with informing the enemy. But is it realistic that enemies would rely solely on public websites for their intel? Maybe they have other sources, or the details on the website are too vague. A question could challenge the assumption that the website's content is detailed enough to aid ISIS. For example: \"Does the level of detail provided on the website actually give ISIS actionable information, or is it too general to be useful?\"\n\nThird, the argument assumes that any public disclosure is harmful. But maybe transparency has benefits, like gaining public support or deterring enemies. So a question could ask about the unaddressed benefits. Like: \"Are there potential strategic advantages to publicly outlining methods to combat ISIS that are not considered in the argument?\"\n\nI need to check if these questions fit the guidelines. They all focus on existing elements in the text (MacArthur comparison, website details, public disclosure). They don't introduce new concepts. Each challenges an assumption in Trump's argument. Also, they don't ask for common sense or are too broad. \n\nAvoiding unhelpful questions: For example, asking \"Why does Trump think MacArthur wouldn't like it?\" would be reading comprehension. Similarly, questions about the consequences of raising taxes are irrelevant here. \n\nAlso, ensuring that the questions don't ask for external evidence but rather probe the internal logic. For example, the MacArthur question is about whether the comparison is valid based on evidence, which Trump doesn't provide. \n\nAnother angle: The equivalence between raising taxes and military strategy. But the main focus is on the ISIS plan, so maybe stick to that part. \n\nYes, the three questions I thought of seem to fit. Let me rephrase them more succinctly:\n\n1. How does publicly outlining strategies on a website equate to providing actionable intelligence to ISIS, and is there evidence that enemies rely on such public sources?\n2. What specific details from the website does Trump reference to support the claim that it reveals too much to ISIS, and are these details sufficient to compromise security?\n3. Does the comparison to General MacArthur hold merit, considering historical context where military strategies were sometimes publicly discussed without compromising missions?\n\nWait, the third one might need to be more precise. The original text mentions MacArthur not liking \"that,\" which is telling the enemy everything. So maybe: \"What is the basis for assuming General MacArthur would oppose publicizing military strategies, and does historical evidence support this assumption?\"\n\nYes, that's better. So final questions could be:\n\n- Does the assumption that publicly detailing strategies to combat ISIS equates to aiding the enemy hold true, given that adversaries may already anticipate such methods?  \n- What evidence supports the claim that General Douglas MacArthur would disapprove of outlining military strategies publicly, and how relevant is his historical approach to modern tactics?  \n- Are there instances where transparently communicating strategies has deterred or disadvantaged adversaries, contradicting the argument's premise?  \n\nBut maybe more concise:\n\n1. How does the level of detail in the website's strategy against ISIS substantiate the claim that it provides useful information to the enemy?\n2. What historical evidence supports the assertion that General MacArthur opposed public discussion of military strategies, and is this comparison applicable to modern contexts?\n3. Does the argument consider that public disclosure of strategies might have strategic benefits, such as deterrence or public assurance, which could outweigh potential risks?\n\nThese questions challenge the validity by targeting the evidence for comparisons, the actual content of the website, and potential overlooked benefits."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text. The text is about the first debate being limited to five people despite 171 candidates filing with the FEC. The main argument seems to be questioning whether all 171 deserve a fair shot at the debate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the argument. The person is pointing out a discrepancy between the number of candidates and the debate slots, implying that limiting the debate to five might be unfair. But to challenge this, the questions need to probe the assumptions or validity here.\n\nUseful questions should challenge the argument without introducing new concepts. Let me brainstorm. \n\nOne angle is the criteria for debate participation. The text mentions filing with the FEC, but debates have other criteria. So asking about the basis for expecting a spot just by filing could be good. That challenges the assumption that filing equals deserving a debate slot.\n\nAnother point is the definition of \"fair shot.\" The text uses that term, but what's considered fair? The question could ask if filing paperwork is sufficient, which might not be the case. That digs into whether the premise is valid.\n\nAlso, the comparison between the 171 candidates and the five slots. Is there a logical link? Maybe questioning if all filers are serious candidates. Some might have filed without a real campaign. That would challenge the argument's validity by pointing out not all filers are equally deserving.\n\nWait, the guidelines say to avoid questions that are too general or common sense. So I need to make sure each question is specific to the text. Let me check the examples again. In example 1, they asked about the comparison's validity and hidden fees. Similarly, here, focusing on the criteria, the definition of fairness, and the seriousness of candidates.\n\nSo possible questions:\n\n1. What criteria determine eligibility for the first debate, and does filing with the FEC alone qualify as meeting those criteria? \n   - This challenges the assumption that filing is enough, which the text seems to imply.\n\n2. Is the act of filing candidacy paperwork with the FEC sufficient grounds to warrant inclusion in the debate, or are there other factors that should be considered? \n   - Similar to the first but phrased differently, focusing on sufficiency of paperwork.\n\n3. How does the argument account for potential differences in campaign viability or public support among the 171 candidates when advocating for equal debate participation? \n   - This questions the assumption that all candidates are equally deserving, introducing the idea of viability.\n\nI need to ensure these don't introduce external concepts. The text mentions FEC filing and the debate limit. The questions stay within those bounds. Also, they challenge the argument's validity by questioning the basis for equating filing with debate eligibility, the definition of fairness, and the lack of differentiation among candidates.\n\nCheck against unhelpful questions: For example, asking why the debate was limited to five is reading comprehension. But here, the questions are about the criteria and assumptions, which are critical. They don't ask for evidence but challenge the underlying reasoning.\n\nInvalid questions would be those introducing new concepts like campaign funding or public opinion, but these questions stick to factors implied by the text (criteria, fairness, viability). \n\nI think these three fit the guidelines. Let me check the examples again to ensure alignment. In example 1, they asked about comparisons and hidden fees. Here, similar structure: criteria, sufficiency of paperwork, and viability. Yes, these should be useful."

First, I need to understand the text thoroughly.\n\nThe text is a statement by ND who agrees that incentivizing certain behaviors helps the economy run smoothly, using South Korea's growth through policies that encouraged saving as an example. However, ND points out that massive debts have been written off, but not for those who need it most in society, despite agreeing that debt relief for productive investments is good.\n\nNow, following the guidelines, the questions should challenge the argument's validity, make the reader reflect, and not introduce new concepts. Let's break down the key points in the text:\n\n1. Incentivizing behavior (like saving in South Korea) is necessary for a smooth economy.\n2. Large debts have been written off, but not for the most needy.\n3. Debt write-offs should be for productive investments.\n\nPotential angles for questions:\n- The comparison between South Korea's policies and current debt write-offs. Are they comparable? Does the example support the argument?\n- The assumption that written-off debts for productive investments are effective. Is there evidence that the debts written off were for productive investments?\n- The discrepancy between writing off debts but not helping the most needy. How does this affect the argument's validity?\n- The criteria for determining which debts are written off. Why are the most needy excluded?\n\nAvoid questions that are too general, common sense, or introduce new concepts. Let's check the examples given earlier for inspiration. For instance, in Example 1, questions challenge the comparison's validity or hidden factors.\n\nPossible questions:\n\n1. How does the example of South Korea's incentivized saving relate to the argument about writing off debts, and does this comparison hold under scrutiny?\n   - Challenges the relevance of the South Korea example to debt relief.\n\n2. What criteria determine which debts are written off, and why might the most needy in society not meet these criteria?\n   - Focuses on the existing detail about needy not getting debt relief, questions the criteria without introducing new ideas.\n\n3. Is there evidence that the debts which were written off were indeed for \"productive investments,\" and how is productivity measured in this context?\n   - Questions the basis of the claim about productive investments, asking for evidence and definitions from the text.\n\nCheck if these are useful: they target specific parts of the argument, challenge assumptions, and don't bring in external concepts. Avoid unhelpful ones like consequences of debt relief (too broad) or asking for evidence without context (already covered). Also, ensure they don't just ask for examples or restatements.

She talks about a plan involving tech companies to stop ISIS online, supporting Arab and Kurdish partners in Raqqa, pushing ISIS out of Iraq, targeting leadership, and disrupting propaganda. The argument assumes that these actions will effectively defeat ISIS.\n\nNow, looking at the guidelines: questions should target the validity of the argument. So, possible angles could be the effectiveness of online measures, the feasibility of military goals, or the evidence behind past successes.\n\nFor example, she mentions working with tech companies. I can question how effective that cooperation has been so far, which challenges the assumption that more action here will work. Another point is pushing ISIS out of Iraq within a year. Is that timeline realistic? Also, she mentions past success with Al Qaeda leadership. Does taking out leaders like bin Laden actually lead to defeating the group, or could it have unintended consequences?\n\nI need to ensure each question is specific to the text and doesn't bring in external factors.

Each should make the reader reflect on potential weaknesses in Clinton's plan based on the details she provides.\n\nChecking the examples, useful questions often challenge comparisons, ask for evidence, or probe underlying assumptions.

Also, what specific evidence shows that working with tech companies will disrupt propaganda effectively?\n\nAvoiding unhelpful questions like consequences of not acting, which might support her argument. Also, not asking about external concepts like economic factors she didn't mention.\n\nOkay, drafting the questions now:\n\n1. How does the effectiveness of targeting ISIS's online presence compare to previous efforts against similar groups, and what evidence supports the assumption that increased cooperation with tech companies will lead to success?\n\n2. What specific factors justify the expectation that ISIS can be pushed out of Iraq within a year, and how does this timeline account for potential challenges or setbacks?\n\n3. Does the strategy of targeting ISIS leadership, as done with Al Qaeda, consider potential unintended consequences such as the rise of more radical factions or decentralized operations?\n\nWait, the third one might be introducing \"decentralized operations,\" which isn't mentioned. Maybe rephrase to focus on the claim's validity based on past outcomes. Like, does the success against Al Qaeda leadership ensure similar results against ISIS, considering possible differences?\n\nYes, better. So revised:\n\n3. What evidence exists that eliminating leaders like Baghdadi will significantly disrupt ISIS, given the group's structure compared to Al Qaeda's when bin Laden was targeted?\n\nThat stays within the text's mention of taking out leadership and past efforts with Al Qaeda."

        "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to generate three useful critical questions for this Clinton text. Let me first read the text carefully to understand the arguments presented.\n\nClinton is responding to Donald's portrayal of black communities as dire and negative. She highlights the vibrancy of the black church, businesses, and opportunities. She mentions that stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional and ineffective, supports community policing, and notes crime statistics showing reductions. She also points out issues with unintended consequences leading to incarceration of young men for nonviolent offenses.\n\nNow, the goal is to create questions that challenge the validity of her arguments. The questions should focus on existing details in the text without introducing new concepts. They should make the reader reflect on potential weaknesses in Clinton's points.\n\nFirst, let's look at her claim that stop-and-frisk was found unconstitutional because it was ineffective. The text says it was \"found to be unconstitutional in part because it was ineffective.\" A useful question could challenge the connection between unconstitutionality and ineffectiveness. Maybe the primary reason for being unconstitutional isn't effectiveness but rather civil rights violations. So a question like: Does the unconstitutionality of stop-and-frisk primarily stem from its ineffectiveness, or were there other factors like civil rights violations that contributed more significantly? But wait, the text says \"in part,\" so maybe the question can highlight whether effectiveness is the main issue here.\n\nSecond, Clinton cites crime statistics (violent crime halved since 1991, property crime down 40%). A critical question could ask whether these statistics directly support the effectiveness of community policing, as she seems to imply. For example: How does the decrease in violent and property crime rates directly correlate with community policing strategies, and are there other factors that might have contributed to these reductions? This challenges the assumption that community policing alone caused the drop.\n\nThird, she mentions unintended consequences leading to incarceration for nonviolent offenses. A question here could challenge the sufficiency of her solution (community policing) in addressing those consequences. Like: What specific aspects of community policing address the issue of nonviolent offenses leading to incarceration, given that past methods had unintended consequences? This questions whether her proposed solution actually tackles the problem she identified.\n\nWait, but in the text, she says \"We've had 25 years of very good cooperation, there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.\" So the 25 years of cooperation (which I assume refers to community policing) still had problems. So maybe a question could ask how community policing, which she supports, addresses those unintended consequences if they occurred during the same period she's citing as successful.\n\nAlternatively, another angle: She says \"violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991... We just don't want to see it creep back up.\" A question could challenge the assumption that current strategies (like community policing) are the reason for the decline and whether stopping other methods (like stop-and-frisk) would risk crime increasing again. But she's arguing against stop-and-frisk, so maybe a question about the evidence linking community policing to the crime reduction she cites.\n\nAnother point: She contrasts stop-and-frisk (ineffective) with community policing (right ways). A question could ask about the criteria used to judge effectiveness between the two methods. For example, how does community policing's effectiveness in reducing crime compare to stop-and-frisk, considering the latter was deemed ineffective?\n\nLet me check the examples given in the guidelines. The useful questions often challenge comparisons, ask for evidence, or point out missing factors. So for Clinton's text:\n\n1. Challenging the basis for linking crime reduction to community policing. The statistics are presented, but does she provide evidence that community policing caused the decrease? The question could be: What evidence directly links the decrease in violent and property crime rates to the implementation of community policing, rather than other factors?\n\n2. Challenging the assertion that stop-and-frisk was ineffective as the reason for being unconstitutional. The question might be: Is the primary reason stop-and-frisk was deemed unconstitutional its ineffectiveness, or were constitutional rights violations a more significant factor?\n\n3. Addressing the unintended consequences despite 25 years of cooperation. The text says \"We've had 25 years of very good cooperation, there were some problems, some unintended consequences.\" So even with community policing (assuming that's the cooperation), there were issues. A question could be: If community policing has been in practice for 25 years with unintended consequences, how does continuing this approach prevent the incarceration of nonviolent offenders?\n\nI need to make sure the questions don't introduce new concepts. Let me rephrase them to fit the text's details and guidelines.\n\nFinal useful questions might be:\n\n1. How does the correlation between the implementation of community policing and the reported decrease in crime rates establish causation, and are there other factors that could have contributed to this decline?\n\n2. Is the claim that stop-and-frisk was found unconstitutional primarily due to ineffectiveness supported by legal rulings, or were violations of constitutional rights the main factor?\n\n3. Given that unintended consequences such as incarceration for nonviolent offenses occurred during the 25 years of cooperation, what specific measures in community policing address these issues to prevent their recurrence?\n\nThese questions target the arguments' validity by challenging causation, the basis for legal decisions, and the effectiveness of proposed solutions in light of past issues."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text about peanut allergies on flights. The guidelines mention that the questions should challenge the argument's validity by focusing on existing details without introducing new concepts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the text. The person, kateinhawaii, argues against buffer zones for peanuts on flights, citing their own experience with severe allergies. They compare peanut buffer zones to ineffective smoking zones, mention flight attendants' attitudes, and claim that peanut dust in the air causes reactions despite air circulation. They also reference Delta and Northwest airlines' different approaches.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, useful questions often challenge comparisons, question assumptions, or point out missing evidence. Let's break down the argument.\n\n1. The comparison between smoking zones and peanut buffer zones. The text assumes they are equivalent, but maybe the situations differ. So a question could ask if the comparison is valid, considering different factors like how smoke vs. peanut dust circulates.\n\n2. The claim that air circulation doesn't remove peanut dust quickly enough. The text states this, but is there evidence provided? A question could challenge the basis of that assertion.\n\n3. The mention of flight attendants' attitudes affecting safety. The argument uses this to support the ineffectiveness of buffer zones, but does their behavior directly impact the physical presence of allergens? A question might ask if their remarks are relevant to the buffer zone's efficacy.\n\nAlso, the person's personal experience is central. While they say it's 100% guaranteed, is there variability in reactions or circumstances that weren't considered? However, asking about personal experience might not challenge validity but rather the generalization.\n\nAnother point: Northwest's approach of banning peanuts worked, but does that mean a complete ban is the only solution? The argument implies that buffer zones don't work, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the text doesn't propose alternatives, so the question should stick to what's present.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- Does the comparison between ineffective smoking zones and peanut buffer zones account for differences in how smoke and peanut dust circulate in airplane cabins? (Challenges the analogy's validity)\n\n- What evidence supports the assertion that airplane air circulation does not remove peanut dust quickly enough to prevent life-threatening reactions? (Questions the basis of the claim)\n\n- How does the behavior of flight attendants towards passengers with allergies affect the actual effectiveness of buffer zones in preventing exposure to peanut allergens? (Asks if the anecdote about attendants is relevant to the buffer zone's physical effectiveness)\n\nThese questions target existing elements in the text (comparison, air circulation claim, flight attendants' behavior) and challenge their validity without introducing new concepts."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given Trump text. First, I need to understand the text properly.\n\nIn the text, Trump is responding to someone (probably during a debate) by criticizing their past behavior towards Obama, mentioning disrespect, sending pictures in certain garb, and a lawsuit he settled without admission of guilt. \n\nNow, I need to apply the guidelines. The questions must challenge the argument's validity without introducing new concepts. Let's break down the main points in Trump's argument:\n\n1. Accusing the opponent of disrespecting Obama, using specific examples (debates, pictures).\n2. Claiming the opponent acts \"holier than thou\" now but was disrespectful before.\n3. Defending the lawsuit by stating it was settled without guilt and was easy, implying it's not a valid criticism.\n\nFor each of these points, I need to find potential weaknesses. \n\nStarting with the Obama disrespect: Trump compares the opponent's past behavior to their current demeanor. A useful question could challenge the validity of this comparison. Maybe ask if past actions towards Obama are relevant to current behavior. Also, he mentions the campaign sending pictures. Are those pictures a fair comparison to the current situation? \n\nNext, the \"holier than thou\" comment. He's saying the opponent can't act morally superior now. But does their past behavior actually contradict their current stance? Maybe question if the past actions indeed invalidate their current arguments. \n\nRegarding the lawsuit: Trump settled without admitting guilt. But does settling without guilt mean the allegations were baseless? Maybe a question about the implications of settling versus being innocent. Also, he mentions many companies were sued, implying it's common. Does that make it acceptable? Maybe challenge the assumption that widespread lawsuits make his case less significant.\n\nI need to ensure the questions don't introduce new concepts. For example, asking about the lawsuit's settlement\u2014does the lack of admission of guilt actually absolve him? That's present in the text. Or challenging the relevance of the Obama comparison.\n\nPossible questions:\n\n1. Does the settlement of the lawsuit without admission of guilt conclusively demonstrate innocence, or could there be other reasons for such a settlement? (Challenges the assumption that settlement equals innocence.)\n\n2. How does the past treatment of Obama by the opponent directly contradict their current behavior or arguments, and is this comparison substantiated? (Questions the relevance and validity of the comparison.)\n\n3. What evidence supports the claim that the opponent's campaign distributed images of Obama in specific attire, and how does this action directly relate to the current accusations of hypocrisy? (Asks for substantiation of the claim and its relevance.)\n\nI should check if these are in line with the examples. The first question about the lawsuit is similar to the examples where they challenge the basis of a claim. The second and third questions focus on the validity of the comparison and the evidence for the claims made, which are present in the text. They don't introduce new concepts but target existing points. Also, they prompt reflection on whether these points actually weaken the opponent's argument. \n\nAvoiding unhelpful questions like \"Why did Trump settle the lawsuit?\" which is too straightforward. Instead, focusing on the implications of the settlement. Also, ensuring the questions are specific and not too broad. \n\nAnother angle: Trump mentions \"many other companies\" were sued. Does that minimize his company's involvement? Maybe a question like \"Does the fact that many companies were sued in the federal lawsuit diminish the significance of Trump's company's involvement, and if so, how?\" But the text says \"many, many other companies,\" so that's present. However, the user's example in Example 1 had a question about comparing credit card ads to food products. So here, comparing the lawsuit to others could be a valid question.\n\nBut maybe the three I thought of earlier are better. Let me check the examples again. For instance, in Example 1, they ask if the comparison between credit card and food is valid. Similarly, here, comparing past behavior to current actions. \n\nYes, so the three questions I drafted should fit. Need to make sure they don't ask for external info or are too vague. Also, avoid questions that are just reading comprehension. The user's examples also ask for evidence, so asking about evidence for the pictures is okay if it's challenging the argument's validity. \n\nFinalizing the three questions:\n\n1. Does the lack of admission of guilt in the lawsuit settlement conclusively demonstrate innocence, or could there be alternative motivations for settling?\n\n2. How does the opponent's past treatment of Obama directly contradict their current stance, and is there evidence that this contradiction undermines their credibility?\n\n3. What specific evidence substantiates the claim that the opponent's campaign distributed images of Obama in particular attire, and how does this action relate to accusations of hypocrisy?\n\nThese questions challenge the validity by asking for proof, questioning relevance, and examining the implications of the settlement. They stay within the text's content and don't introduce new concepts."

First, I need to understand the text thoroughly. The main argument here is that airlines shouldn't discriminate against passengers with lower fares or those using miles because the airline is responsible for giving them seats. The text claims that without proper compensation, airlines have no incentive to schedule properly and might exploit passengers by bumping them for higher-paying ones, leading to hidden costs and unfair treatment.\n\nNow, following the guidelines, useful questions should challenge the argument's validity by focusing on existing details without introducing new concepts. Let's break down the argument to find potential weaknesses. \n\nThe first point is about the incentive for proper scheduling. The text assumes that higher compensation is necessary for proper scheduling. Maybe the link between compensation and scheduling isn't proven. So a question like, \"Does the level of compensation directly influence airlines' scheduling practices, and is there evidence supporting this causation?\" That challenges the assumption that compensation drives scheduling.\n\nNext, the text compares bumping passengers to increasing ticket prices post-purchase. Is this comparison valid? A question could ask about the validity of equating these two actions, since one involves changing prices after sale and the other is about service denial. For example, \"How does the act of bumping passengers equate to increasing ticket prices post-purchase, and does this analogy hold under scrutiny?\"\n\nThird, the argument states that hidden costs occur when bumped. But does the text provide evidence that these costs are significant or common? A question might be, \"Are the hidden costs associated with being bumped substantiated, and do they outweigh the benefits airlines gain from overbooking?\" This questions the existence and impact of hidden costs.\n\nI need to ensure these questions don't ask for external info or are too broad. Let me check each against the examples. The first question targets the compensation-scheduling link, present in the text. The second challenges a comparison made in the text.

However, the text doesn't mention that, so that might be introducing a new concept. Avoid that.\n\nSo possible questions:\n1. How does the comparison between commercial and private planes support the argument for banning nuts, and is this comparison logically consistent?\n2. What assumptions are being made about the airline's ability to enforce a nut ban versus their current policies, and are these assumptions valid?\n3. Does the existence of a loophole in current policies necessarily justify a complete ban, or could there be alternative solutions that address the issue without such a broad prohibition?\n\nWait, the third one might be okay.

Let's see. The first point he makes is that the deal should have included other countries like North Korea. So maybe a question about the assumption that including those countries was feasible or relevant. Like, why does he think Iran's influence over NK means they should be part of the deal? That's a valid challenge.\n\nThen he mentions the cash payments, initially $400 million, then corrected to $1.7 billion. He links it to hostages.

That's a contradiction worth questioning.\n\n3. She says Trump's invitation was shocking. But does a public statement directly lead to increased hacking? Maybe question the causal link here.\n\nAvoiding common sense or external ideas. Each question should focus on existing points. Let me check the examples again to ensure alignment.

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. So, the user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for Clinton's text. The guidelines say the questions should challenge the argument's validity, make the reader reflect, and not introduce new concepts.\n\nFirst, let me parse the text. Clinton is talking about the recovery from a crisis (probably the 2008 recession) and argues against returning to past policies. She mentions job losses, home losses, and wealth wiped out. Then she says they're on the precipice of a better economy. She contrasts her clean energy plans with Trump's view on climate change.\n\nUseful questions need to challenge her points. Let's see. She says \"the last thing we need is to go back to the policies that failed.\" A question could ask about the link between past policies and the crisis. Like, what specific policies caused the problems, and are the ones she's opposing the same?\n\nThen she mentions independent experts analyzing her and Donald's proposals. Maybe question the independence or evidence from these experts. Are they truly unbiased?\n\nOn clean energy, she claims some country will be the superpower. But does that necessarily mean the US should pursue it? Also, she contrasts her view on climate change with Donald's. But does Donald's belief affect the validity of her argument? Maybe challenge the relevance of his opinion to her policy's effectiveness.\n\nWait, another angle: she says they're on the precipice of a better economy. What evidence supports that the current policies are working, and how does reverting to old policies threaten that? Also, the $13 trillion loss and recovery\u2014is the recovery quantified? Are the numbers presented in a way that might be misleading?\n\nAlso, the comparison between her and Donald's proposals. She says experts looked at both, but does that mean hers are better? Maybe question if the analysis actually shows her proposals are superior.\n\nFor the climate part: linking being a clean energy superpower to climate change being real. Is that connection valid? Or is it an appeal to fear rather than policy effectiveness.\n\nPotential questions:\n\n1. What specific policies does Clinton attribute to the previous economic crisis, and how do the current opposing proposals directly relate to those failed policies? (Challenges the assumption that the opposing policies are the same as the failed ones.)\n\n2. How does Clinton's assertion that Donald Trump views climate change as a hoax directly impact the validity or effectiveness of her own clean energy proposals? (Questions the relevance of Trump's view to her argument.)\n\n3. What evidence do the independent experts provide that Clinton's proposals will lead to a better economy compared to the previous policies, and are these experts' analyses free from bias? (Challenges the credibility of the experts and the evidence.)\n\nI need to make sure these questions don't introduce new concepts, stay within the text, and target the argument's validity. Let me check the examples again. For instance, in Example 1, the questions focus on comparing credit card ads to food labels, asking about validity of comparisons and hidden details. Similarly, here, the questions should focus on the links Clinton makes between past policies and current proposals, the role of experts, and the relevance of Trump's stance.\n\nAnother angle: the $13 trillion loss\u2014how does the recovery measure against that? Is there evidence the current policies are responsible for the recovery? But the text says \"we have come back\" but doesn't specify the role of policies. So a question could be: What evidence links the economic recovery to current policies rather than other factors, thereby justifying the avoidance of past policies? That might work.\n\nBut I need three. Let me rephrase the ones I thought of to fit the guidelines better.\n\n1. What specific evidence connects the policies Clinton opposes to the economic crisis she describes, and how do her proposed policies avoid repeating those failures? (Targets the causality between past policies and the crisis, and the effectiveness of her proposals.)\n\n2. How does the assertion that Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax substantiate the claim that transitioning to clean energy will benefit the economy, and is this assertion relevant to evaluating her policy's merits? (Challenges the relevance of Trump's view to her argument's validity.)\n\n3. In what ways have the independent experts demonstrated that Clinton's proposals are superior to Donald's, and what criteria were used to assess their potential economic impact? (Questions the basis of the expert analysis and its objectivity.)\n\nYes, these questions target the argument's core, challenge the links made, and don't introduce external ideas. They make the reader evaluate whether Clinton's claims are supported and relevant."

The text is a statement from Clinton talking about tax proposals, corporate tax rates, repatriation of money overseas, and her support for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the argument here. Clinton is saying that she doesn't see changes in the corporate tax rates or proposals that would cause repatriation, but she supports that idea. So the main points are about corporate tax rates, repatriation, and her stance.\n\nNow, to generate useful questions that challenge the validity. The guidelines say to focus on details in the text without introducing new concepts. Let's break down the elements.\n\n1. She mentions not seeing changes in corporate tax rates. So maybe question the connection between tax rates and repatriation. Like, how do tax rates specifically influence repatriation? That challenges the assumption that tax rate changes are necessary for repatriation.\n\n2. She supports repatriation. What evidence is there that repatriating money would have the intended effect? Maybe companies just use the money for stock buybacks instead of investment.\n\n3. She says the proposals don't cause repatriation. Is there a reason why the current proposals wouldn't lead to that? Maybe the existing proposals have other factors that prevent repatriation.\n\nAlso, check if the questions are not common sense or too broad. Avoid questions that just ask for evidence, but instead target the logic or assumptions in the argument.\n\nAnother angle: She supports repatriation but doesn't see the proposals causing it. Is there a gap between her support and the proposals' effectiveness? Maybe the proposals lack certain elements, so the question could ask about the alignment between her support and the proposals' structure.\n\nWait, the text says \"I do n't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you 're referring to that would cause the repatriation... I happen to support that\". So she's saying the current proposals (from the opponent?) don't include changes that would cause repatriation, but she supports such changes. So perhaps the questions should challenge the link between corporate tax rates and repatriation, or the effectiveness of her support.\n\nPossible questions:\n\n- How does Clinton reconcile her support for repatriation with the absence of proposed changes to corporate tax rates that she claims are necessary?\n\nBut need to ensure it's based on the text. The text says she doesn't see changes in corporate tax rates or proposals that would cause repatriation, but she supports that (repatriation). So maybe the question is challenging the assumption that tax rate changes are needed for repatriation. Like, is there evidence that corporate tax rate changes directly lead to repatriation of overseas funds?\n\nAnother angle: Are there alternative factors beyond tax rates that could influence companies' decisions to repatriate money, which Clinton's argument overlooks?\n\nOr, does the lack of proposed changes in corporate tax rates necessarily mean that repatriation won't occur, or are there other mechanisms in the proposals that could still encourage it?\n\nAlso, she mentions \"the kinds of proposals you're referring to\". So maybe asking about the specific elements in the proposals that she thinks are insufficient. But the text doesn't detail the proposals, so the question must not introduce new concepts.\n\nAnother idea: Is there a basis for the claim that repatriation is dependent on changes to corporate tax rates, and if so, how does this align with historical instances of tax policy changes affecting corporate behavior?\n\nBut the text doesn't mention historical instances, so that might introduce external concepts. Need to stick to what's there.\n\nMaybe: What specific aspects of the current proposals does Clinton believe fail to address the repatriation of overseas funds, and why does she consider those aspects inadequate?\n\nBut the text doesn't specify the aspects, so the question might be invalid as it asks for info not present.\n\nAlternatively: Does Clinton provide evidence that maintaining current corporate tax rates prevents the repatriation of overseas money, and if not, how does this affect the validity of her argument?\n\nThat could work. It's challenging the link between tax rates and repatriation, which is central to her argument.\n\nAnother possible question: How does the absence of proposed changes in corporate tax rates directly lead to the continued stranding of money overseas, as Clinton implies?\n\nThis questions the causal relationship she's suggesting.\n\nSo, compiling these, the three questions could be:\n\n1. Is there evidence that maintaining current corporate tax rates prevents the repatriation of overseas funds, as Clinton implies?\n\n2. What alternative factors, beyond corporate tax rates, could influence companies' decisions to repatriate money that Clinton's argument does not address?\n\n3. How does the absence of proposed changes in corporate tax rates directly lead to the continued stranding of money overseas, and what assumptions underpin this causal relationship?\n\nWait, the third one might be a bit long. Maybe simplify: How does the absence of corporate tax rate changes directly cause the stranding of overseas funds, as Clinton suggests?\n\nAlternatively: What assumptions is Clinton making about the relationship between corporate tax rates and the repatriation of overseas funds?\n\nBut that's a bit broad. Need to ensure each question is specific and challenges the argument's validity based on the text provided."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text. The text is a conversation between Howie and jsooudi about food allergies, specifically regarding children and airline policies. Howie is skeptical about the severity of food allergies, suggesting they're overblown and possibly psychosomatic, while jsooudi shares her personal experience as a physician and mother of a child with severe allergies.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the arguments each side is making. Howie argues that food allergies are exaggerated, allergists are pseudoscientists, and implies that some parents might be fabricating their children's allergies (Munchausen by Proxy). He also questions the validity of severe allergies, saying most kids outgrow them by 5. Jsooudi counters with her son's severe reactions, the challenges of air travel, and the need for peanut-free zones.\n\nTo create useful questions, I need to challenge Howie's arguments without introducing new concepts. Let me brainstorm:\n\n1. Howie claims allergists are not doctors. Is that true? The question would challenge his credibility attack on allergists. But wait, do allergists have medical degrees? Yes, they are physicians. So questioning the basis of his statement that \"Allergists are not doctors\" would be a valid critique. That's a factual inaccuracy, so pointing that out could weaken his argument.\n\n2. Howie says most kids outgrow allergies by 5. Jsooudi's son is 4. The question could ask whether Howie's dismissal of allergies before 5 ignores cases where allergies persist beyond that age. Since jsooudi's son is nearing 5 and still has severe allergies, this challenges Howie's assumption.\n\n3. Howie implies that having three life-threatening allergies is suspicious, suggesting Munchausen by Proxy. But jsooudi is a physician and epidemiologist. A question could ask if Howie's skepticism accounts for her medical expertise, thus challenging his implication of fabrication.\n\nAlso, Howie compares allergists to pseudoscientists. A question could challenge the validity of equating allergists with pseudoscience, especially given medical recognition of allergies.\n\nAnother point: Howie says \"almost no one is actually that allergic,\" but jsooudi provides a detailed account. A question could ask if Howie's generalization overlooks documented severe cases.\n\nI need to ensure questions don't introduce external concepts. For example, asking about statistics on allergies would be external, but referring to the text's own examples is okay.\n\nPossible questions:\n\n- Does Howie provide evidence to support the claim that allergists are not doctors, and how does this affect the credibility of his argument? (But the text says Howie states \"Allergists are not doctors,\" which is false. So the question could challenge the basis of that claim.)\n\n- How does Howie's assertion that most children outgrow food allergies by age five account for cases where severe allergies persist beyond that age, as described by jsooudi? (This uses the text's example to challenge his generalization.)\n\n- What is the basis for Howie's implication that having three life-threatening allergies is suspicious, and does this account for the medical expertise of the parent as presented in the response? (Challenges the ad hominem against jsooudi.)\n\nCheck if these are valid per guidelines. They should challenge the argument's validity, focus on existing details, and not introduce new concepts.\n\nAnother angle: Howie's dismissal of severe reactions as hypochondria. Jsooudi's son had anaphylaxis. A question could ask if Howie's dismissal ignores documented medical emergencies.\n\nBut phrasing is key. Let me refine:\n\n1. What evidence supports Howie's claim that allergists are not doctors, and how does this claim impact the validity of his argument against food allergy severity?\n\nBut maybe too long. Simplify: How does Howie substantiate the assertion that allergists are not doctors, and does this undermine his credibility regarding allergy skepticism?\n\nAlternatively: What is the basis for Howie's assertion that allergists are not doctors, and how does this affect the validity of his argument against their credibility?\n\nAnother: How does Howie reconcile his claim that allergists are not doctors with the medical community's recognition of allergists as licensed physicians?\n\nBut the text doesn't mention the medical community, so that's introducing external info. Must avoid that.\n\nStick to the text. Howie says allergists are pseudoscientists and not doctors. The question can challenge the factual basis of that statement as per the text.\n\nSo, first question: What evidence does Howie provide to support the claim that allergists are not doctors, and how does this affect his argument's credibility?\n\nSecond: How does Howie's assertion that most children outgrow allergies by age five address cases like jsooudi's son, who is nearly five with severe allergies?\n\nThird: What justification does Howie offer for implying that having three life-threatening allergies is suspicious, particularly when the parent is a physician with documented medical evidence?\n\nCheck if these are in line with examples. The examples often ask for the basis of comparisons, challenge assumptions, or ask for missing factors.\n\nYes, these questions target specific claims in the text, challenge their validity by pointing to contradictions or lack of evidence, and don't introduce external concepts."

The guidelines say the questions should challenge the argument's validity by focusing on existing details without introducing new concepts. Let me start by understanding the text.\n\nTrump is arguing that he has better judgment and temperament than Clinton. He mentions spending on ads, Madison Avenue, and refers to an AFL-CIO event where Clinton was \"out of control.\" The core claims here are about his superior temperament and judgment, supported by examples like the ad spending and the AFL-CIO incident.\n\nFirst, I need to find points where the argument might be weak. For example, Trump claims temperament is his strongest asset. A useful question might challenge how he measures temperament. The text doesn't provide specific criteria, so asking about the basis for comparing temperament would target that gap.\n\nNext, he mentions Clinton's ad spending and Madison Avenue. A question could ask if there's a direct link between ad spending and judgment. Since the text doesn't establish that connection, this challenges the validity of using ad spending as evidence of poor judgment.\n\nThen, the AFL-CIO incident. He describes her as out of control but gives no context. A question could ask how that incident specifically relates to temperament, pointing out the lack of details to support his claim.\n\nI need to avoid questions that are too general or common sense. For example, asking if temperament is important for leadership is too broad. Instead, focusing on the specific comparisons and examples he uses would be better. Also, ensure each question is based solely on the text without introducing external ideas.\n\nSo, the three questions would focus on the criteria for temperament comparison, the link between ad spending and judgment, and the relevance of the AFL-CIO example to Clinton's temperament.

        "reasoning": "Okay, I need to generate three useful critical questions for the given text by Doctor-Mom arguing for a full ban on peanut products on airlines. Let me start by understanding the argument.\n\nThe main points Doctor-Mom makes are:\n1. Peanut reactions can be life-threatening through contact or inhalation, not just consumption.\n2. Restricting peanuts to certain flights isn't enough because residues remain.\n3. Buffer zones are impractical.\n4. There are many other food choices, so peanuts aren't necessary.\n5. She's a physician and author with a support forum, implying expertise.\n6. Banning peanuts could save lives.\n\nNow, I need to create questions that challenge these points without introducing new concepts. Let's break down each part.\n\nFirst, she claims that reactions can happen via contact or inhalation. Are there studies showing that the levels of peanut particles on planes are sufficient to cause reactions? The text doesn't provide specific evidence, so a question about the evidence for the prevalence and severity of such reactions on planes would challenge the basis of the argument.\n\nNext, she says residues can be rampant. Is there data on how long peanut residues persist on planes and if standard cleaning methods remove them? If not, questioning the assumption about residue's persistence could undermine the argument for a ban.\n\nThen, she dismisses buffer zones as impractical. But how effective are buffer zones compared to a full ban? If buffer zones have been tested and failed, the argument holds, but if not, the dismissal might be premature.\n\nShe also asks why peanuts are necessary given other choices. However, maybe peanuts are chosen for cost, shelf-life, or customer preference. A question about the necessity without considering these factors challenges her dismissal.\n\nHer credentials as a physician and author with a forum add authority. But does her forum's size (3000 members) represent a significant portion of those affected? If not, her representation might be questioned.\n\nThe conclusion that the ban would save many lives assumes that current measures are insufficient. Are there statistics on in-flight peanut-related fatalities or incidents? Without evidence, the life-saving claim might be overstated.\n\nPutting this together, possible questions:\n\n1. What evidence supports the claim that peanut residues on flights are sufficient to cause life-threatening reactions through contact or inhalation? (Challenges the severity and prevalence)\n2. How do buffer zones' practical failures compare to the feasibility and effectiveness of a full ban in preventing allergic reactions? (Questions the dismissal of buffer zones)\n3. Are there documented cases where existing measures (like buffer zones or restricted flights) failed to prevent severe allergic reactions, necessitating a full ban? (Seeks evidence for the necessity of the ban)\n\nThese questions target specific parts of the argument, asking for evidence and challenging assumptions without introducing new concepts."

Reaper527 points out a shift in political stance and past mockery of Republicans.\n\nNow, to create useful questions that challenge validity without introducing new concepts. Let me think.\n\n1. The first argument by 17th links working and being part of society to deserving coverage. A useful question might challenge the assumption that working automatically entitles someone to coverage.

Reaper527 contrasts Democrats supporting coverage now vs. Republicans mocked before. A question could ask if the shift is due to policy change or other factors, challenging the implied hypocrisy.\n\nLet me check the examples. In example 1, they asked about comparisons and validity. Similarly, here, comparing working to deserving coverage, and the xenophobia label.\n\nAvoiding common sense: Don't ask why coverage is important, but focus on the link between work and entitlement.

The text is a statement from Clinton criticizing Donald (probably Trump). The main points Clinton makes are:\n\n1. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq, which is proven repeatedly.\n2. Donald advocated for actions in Libya, urging Gadhafi's removal after doing business with him.\n3. Argues that George W. Bush, not Obama, made the agreement on troop withdrawal from Iraq, and the Iraqi government wouldn't agree to protect US troops, so they had to leave.\n\nClinton is trying to show that Donald's positions are inconsistent or that his claims are false. The goal is to challenge the validity of her arguments.\n\nNow, applying the guidelines. Useful questions should challenge the argument, prompt reflection to weaken validity, and focus on existing details without introducing new concepts.\n\nFirst, looking at the claim about Iraq invasion. Clinton says it's \"absolutely proved over and over again.\" A useful question might challenge the evidence or the nature of the proof. For example, asking whether the evidence provided actually conclusively proves support, or if there's ambiguity.\n\nSecond, the Libya part: Donald is accused of advocating for Gadhafi's removal after doing business with him. A question could ask about the connection between his business dealings and his advocacy. Does the text provide a direct link, or is it implied?\n\nThird, the point about Bush vs. Obama on troop withdrawal. Clinton argues that Bush made the agreement and the Iraqi government wouldn't protect troops. A useful question might challenge the necessity of the Iraqi government's agreement. Were there alternatives to keeping troops there without their agreement? Or does the text assume that there was no other option?\n\nLet me check the examples to ensure alignment. For instance, in Example 1, they ask about the basis for comparisons and hidden fees. Similarly, here, asking about the basis for connecting business with Gadhafi to advocating his removal would be analogous.\n\nPotential questions:\n\n1. Does the evidence cited by Clinton conclusively prove Donald's support for the Iraq invasion, or could there be alternative interpretations of his position?\n2. Is there a direct link between Donald's past business dealings with Gadhafi and his later advocacy for military action in Libya, as implied by Clinton?\n3. What evidence supports the claim that the Iraqi government's refusal to provide protections for US troops was the sole reason for their withdrawal, and were there alternative options available?\n\nI need to make sure these are focused on existing details, don't introduce new concepts, and challenge the argument's validity. Let me rephrase them to be more concise and in line with the examples.\n\nFirst question: Focus on whether the \"proven over and over\" actually covers all aspects of support. Maybe: How does the repeated assertion that Donald supported the Iraq invasion account for any potential nuances or changes in his position over time?\n\nSecond: Link between business and advocacy. Maybe: Does the text provide evidence that Donald's business dealings with Gadhafi directly influenced his later advocacy for military action in Libya?\n\nThird: The necessity of the Iraqi government's agreement. Maybe: What specific evidence is presented to establish that the Iraqi government's refusal was the only factor preventing US troops from remaining, and were there other feasible alternatives?\n\nCheck against the guidelines. They don't introduce new concepts, challenge the validity by questioning the evidence or assumptions, and are based on the text. They don't ask for examples or comprehension, but rather critical evaluation. These should be valid."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given Trump text. First, I need to understand the argument in the text. Trump is contrasting his policies (tax cuts, deregulation) with his opponent's (tax increases, increased regulations). He claims his tax cut is the biggest since Reagan, will create jobs, and that businesses appreciate the regulation cuts more than the tax cuts. He also says the opponent's policies will drive businesses out and increase regulations.\n\nNow, I need to find questions that challenge the validity of these arguments. Useful questions should target the assumptions, evidence, or comparisons made without introducing new concepts. Let's break down each part.\n\n1. When he says \"the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan,\" is that comparison accurate? What data supports that? This challenges the validity by questioning the factual basis of the claim. \n\n2. He links tax cuts to job creation. Is there evidence that tax cuts directly lead to job growth? Maybe there are other factors. This targets the causation without evidence.\n\n3. He claims businesses care more about regulation cuts than tax cuts. How does he know that? Is there data or surveys? This questions the basis of that assertion.\n\nI need to check if these questions are present in the text and don't bring in external ideas. Let me see. The text mentions Reagan comparison, job creation from tax cuts, and businesses preferring regulation cuts. The questions target those points directly. \n\nAre there other possible angles? Maybe the assertion that regulations are a disaster. A question like \"What evidence supports the claim that current regulations are a disaster?\" That's also valid, but similar to the ones I have. \n\nAvoiding common sense: For example, \"Do tax cuts increase jobs?\" might be too general. Need specifics from the text. \n\nAnother point: Trump says opponents will drive business out. A question could challenge the causality here. \"How does increasing taxes and regulations directly lead to businesses leaving?\" But the user example shows similar structure. \n\nWait, the user examples use questions like \"Does the credit card company's offer... accurately reflect the true cost?\" So targeting the comparison or causality. \n\nI think the three I initially thought of fit. Let me verify against the guidelines. They challenge specific claims, ask for evidence or basis, and don't introduce new concepts. They are specific to the text's arguments. \n\nYes, these should work. Make sure each question is concise and doesn't have multiple parts. The examples sometimes have two parts, but here maybe stick to one per line. So the final three would be:\n\n- What evidence supports the claim that the tax cut will create \"tremendous numbers of new jobs,\" and are there historical examples where similar tax cuts did not lead to job growth?\n\n- How does the comparison of the tax cut to Ronald Reagan's policies establish its effectiveness, and is there data to confirm it is the largest since that time?\n\n- What specific regulations are cited as causing businesses to fail or preventing new companies from forming, and how does cutting them directly address these issues?"

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle generating three useful critical questions for Clinton's text. First, I need to understand her main arguments. She's advocating for policies like paid family leave, affordable childcare, debt-free college, and making the wealthy pay more. She's contrasting her plans with Trump's and asking voters to judge based on who can deliver these plans.\n\nNow, to create useful questions that challenge the validity. The guidelines say to focus on existing details, avoid new concepts, and prompt reflection that could weaken the argument. \n\nStarting with her claim that making the wealthy pay their fair share will fund these programs. A question could challenge the sufficiency of this funding method. Like, does closing loopholes and taxing the wealthy actually generate enough revenue? That's present in the text and challenges the feasibility.\n\nNext, she links sharing profits with employees to helping balance work and family. Is there a direct connection here? The text doesn't explain how profit-sharing addresses family-work balance, so questioning that link could be useful.\n\nThen, she says debt-free college and affordable childcare will make lives better. But what about long-term economic impacts? Maybe these policies have unintended consequences not addressed. So, a question on whether these actually lead to better lives without negative effects.\n\nI should avoid questions that are too broad or introduce new concepts. For example, asking about specific loopholes she'd close would be good, but if the text doesn't mention any, that's introducing new ideas. Wait, she does mention closing corporate loopholes, so maybe a question on how closing them ensures enough funds. But the first question already covers that. Alternatively, maybe the effectiveness of her plans in achieving the goals.\n\nAnother angle: comparing her and Trump's ability to handle the presidency. She asks voters to judge based on that. A question might challenge the assumption that her plans are actionable, but the text doesn't give specifics on how she'll implement them. So, a question could ask about the feasibility of her plans given political obstacles, but that's not in the text. Wait, she says \"put into action the plans,\" so maybe asking how the proposed funding mechanisms ensure the plans' sustainability. But I think the first question about sufficiency is better.\n\nSo the three useful questions could be:\n\n1. Does the assertion that requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share and closing corporate loopholes sufficiently address the funding needs for the proposed policies like paid family leave and debt-free college?\n\n2. How does profit-sharing among employees directly contribute to alleviating the struggles of balancing family and work, as implied in the initial statement?\n\n3. What evidence supports the claim that implementing debt-free college and affordable childcare will unequivocally lead to better lives, and are there potential unintended consequences not addressed?\n\nWait, the third question introduces \"unequivocally\" which might be adding a new concept. Maybe rephrase to focus on whether there's evidence and if consequences are considered. The text says \"make your life better,\" so questioning the evidence behind that claim is valid without adding new ideas.\n\nYes, that works. Each question targets an existing part of the argument and challenges its validity without bringing in external factors."

        "reasoning": "Okay, I need to generate three useful critical questions for the given Trump text. Let's start by analyzing the text.\n\nTrump is saying that Clinton and other politicians should have been doing \"this\" for years, not just now. He mentions creating a movement and the country's debt of $20 trillion as a reason they can't continue. The main arguments here seem to be blaming past politicians for not acting sooner, the creation of a movement, and the national debt as a problem that's now insurmountable.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core parts of his argument. The key points are: 1) Politicians like Clinton failed to act in the past. 2) A movement has been created (presumably by Trump). 3) The $20 trillion debt is a critical issue making current action impossible.\n\nFor useful questions, they should challenge the validity without introducing new concepts. Let's take each argument point by point.\n\n1. On the claim that politicians should have acted earlier: What's the basis for assuming they didn't? Maybe they did, but Trump is dismissing their efforts. So a question could ask what evidence there is that they didn't act, or if their actions were insufficient.\n\n2. The movement's role: He says \"we've created a movement,\" implying it's a solution. But how does creating a movement directly address the economic issues? A question could challenge the connection between the movement and solving the debt/jobs problem.\n\n3. The $20 trillion debt as a barrier: He states they can't do it anymore because of the debt. But is the debt the only factor preventing action? Are there other reasons, or is the debt being used as a scapegoat? A question could ask if the debt alone makes action impossible or if other factors are involved.\n\nNow, phrasing these into questions following the guidelines. Avoid common sense or external concepts. Make sure each question targets a specific part of the argument.\n\nFirst question: Challenges the assumption that politicians didn't act. \"What specific actions does Trump assert that Secretary Clinton and other politicians failed to take in the past, and is there evidence that these actions were neglected?\" This focuses on the text's claim and asks for evidence.\n\nSecond question: Targets the movement's effectiveness. \"How does the creation of a movement directly address the issues of national debt and economic decline as presented in the argument?\" It questions the link between the movement and solving the problems mentioned.\n\nThird question: Questions the debt's role as a barrier. \"Is the assertion that 'we can not do it any longer' solely based on the national debt, and are there alternative factors that could allow for continued action despite the debt?\" Challenges the sufficiency of the debt as the sole reason.\n\nCheck against unhelpful or invalid categories. These questions don't introduce new concepts, aren't too broad, and each challenges a specific part of the argument. They require reflection on the validity of the claims made, potentially weakening the argument if answered critically."
