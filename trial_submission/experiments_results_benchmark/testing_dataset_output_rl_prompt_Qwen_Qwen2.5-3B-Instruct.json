My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.\nI am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.\nIf I eat a peanut I'll get sick.\nI ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.\nIt was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.\nI would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.\nEverybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.\"\"",

Critical questions should focus on the validity of her arguments regarding wealth redistribution, the feasibility of implementing her proposed policies, and the fairness of her approach to tax policy.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nShould Clinton's proposal to have the wealthy pay their fair share and close corporate loopholes be expected to lead to significant income redistribution, or might it primarily benefit the middle class rather than those at the lower end?\nHow realistic is it to expect businesses and corporations to voluntarily provide affordable child care and debt-free college, especially given current economic realities?\nIs it fair for Clinton to suggest that the wealthy should contribute more to society through taxes, when her own party has historically supported policies that limit or eliminate such contributions?",
