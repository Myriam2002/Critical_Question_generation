        "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text. The text is a quote from someone named MT who is responding to Claire. The main points MT is making are that a form of capitalism wasn't generating enough surpluses, so money didn't flow into industrial activities in the developed world because they weren't profitable enough.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on challenging the argument's validity based on the text's existing details. Let me break down the argument step by step. MT claims that insufficient surpluses led money to not flow into industrial activities. The key elements here are the causality between surpluses and money flow, the assumption that industrial activities weren't making enough money, and perhaps the comparison or basis for what's considered \"sufficient.\"\n\nSo, useful questions should target these areas. Maybe question the link between surpluses and capital flow. The text says \"therefore where did the money flow,\" implying causation. But is that causation proven? Another point is the assumption that industrial activities weren't generating enough money. What's the evidence for that? Also, MT mentions \"that form of capitalism\" \u2013 what defines that form? Without clarity, the argument might be vague.\n\nI should avoid questions that are too general or introduce new concepts. For example, asking about alternative economic systems would be invalid because it's not mentioned. Also, avoid asking for definitions if the text doesn't provide them.\n\nPossible useful questions:\n1. What evidence supports the claim that insufficient surpluses directly caused money to avoid industrial activities? (Challenges the causation)\n2. How is \"sufficient surpluses\" defined, and who determines this threshold? (Questions the basis of the claim)\n3. Are there alternative factors besides profitability that could explain the lack of investment in industrial activities? (Challenges the assumption by considering other variables)\n\nWait, the third question might introduce alternative factors not mentioned. The text only mentions profitability as the reason. So maybe that's introducing new concepts. Let me adjust. Instead, maybe focus on the assumption that profitability is the sole driver. So rephrase: Does the text provide evidence that profitability was the sole reason for the lack of investment, excluding other possible factors? That stays within the text's assertion and challenges the completeness of the reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, another angle: How does the text justify equating the absence of money flow to industrial activities with their insufficient profitability? That questions the link between the two.\n\nHmm, need to ensure each question is tightly focused on the text. Let me check the examples again. The user's examples asked about comparisons, evidence, and hidden aspects. So here, challenging the causation, the definitions, and the underlying assumptions.\n\nI think the first two are solid. The third one needs to avoid introducing new ideas. Let me try again.\n\nThird question: Is the assertion that industrial activities weren't making enough money supported by specific data or just assumed? That challenges the evidence without adding external factors.\n\nYes, that works. So the three questions would be:\n\n1. What evidence supports the direct link between insufficient surpluses and the diversion of money away from industrial activities?\n2. How is the term \"sufficient surpluses\" quantified or defined within the context of the argument presented?\n3. Does the text provide empirical data to substantiate the claim that industrial activities in the developed world were not generating enough profit?\n\nWait, the third one is about empirical data. The original text says \"because in the developed world that wasn't making enough money.\" The question would challenge whether that's supported by data or just stated. That's valid.\n\nAlternatively, another angle: Is there consideration of other economic factors besides surplus generation that influence investment in industrial sectors? But that might be introducing new concepts. The text only mentions surplus as the reason. So maybe not. So sticking to the evidence question is better.\n\nYes, those three should fit the guidelines."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text. The text is about someone's experience on a flight where they couldn't eat due to a nut allergy announcement. The argument is against airlines restricting passengers' food, instead of just not serving nuts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points. The author argues that banning served nuts is okay, but restricting passengers' own food is not. They say you can't eliminate all risks. Also, they mention their own experience of going hungry as a reason why the policy is too strict.\n\nGuidelines say questions should challenge the argument's validity by focusing on existing details. So, I need to find parts of the argument that might have weaknesses. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author compares the risk of passengers eating their own nuts to the airline serving cashews. But maybe the airline's policy is about minimizing risk, not eliminating it. So a question could challenge the comparison's validity.\n\nAnother point is the personal anecdote. They had a bad experience, but does that mean the policy is unnecessary? Maybe the question could ask if the personal experience is a strong enough reason against the policy.\n\nAlso, the author says \"NOTHING in life is risk-free,\" but does that argument hold? Just because you can't eliminate all risks, does that mean you shouldn't mitigate some? That's a common reasoning flaw, so a question there.\n\nAlso, the author supports not serving peanuts but opposes restrictions on passengers. Is there a difference in risk between served peanuts and passengers' snacks? Maybe the airline's serving is a bigger risk because it's widespread, but the author's example of someone eating at the airport and not washing hands is a different scenario. So a question about whether the two scenarios are equivalent in risk.\n\nLet me check the examples given. The first example's useful questions challenge comparisons and evidence. So here, maybe challenging the comparison between airline-served nuts and passenger-brought nuts. Also, the use of personal experience as evidence.\n\nPossible questions:\n\n1. Does the personal experience of going without food justify opposing restrictions on passenger snacks, or does it overlook the severity of allergic reactions? (Challenges the anecdote's relevance.)\n\n2. Is the comparison between the risk of in-flight nut service and passenger-brought snacks valid, given differing exposure levels? (Questions the equivalence in risk.)\n\n3. By stating that eliminating all risk is impossible, does the argument dismiss the effectiveness of incremental risk reduction measures like passenger restrictions? (Challenges the all-or-nothing reasoning.)\n\nI need to make sure the questions don't introduce new concepts. They should focus on existing points: the personal story, the risk comparison, and the impossibility of eliminating all risk.\n\nAvoid unhelpful questions like \"Why did the crew announce the nut allergy?\" which is comprehension. Invalid would be something unrelated, like asking about other allergies not mentioned.\n\nSo final questions:\n\n- Does the author's personal experience of inconvenience sufficiently address the necessity of in-flight nut restrictions for allergy safety?\n\n- How does the argument justify the distinction between airline-served nuts and passenger-consumed nuts in terms of risk magnitude and manageability?\n\n- If eliminating all risk is impossible, does the argument overlook the potential benefits of reducing risk through passenger restrictions despite residual dangers?"

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to generate three useful critical questions for this Trump text. First, I'll read the text carefully.\n\nHe mentions being endorsed by over 200 admirals and generals, ICE, and 16,500 Border Patrol agents. He contrasts these endorsements with \"political hacks\" and criticizes the current leadership. Also, he doubts Russia's involvement in the DNC breach.\n\nUseful questions should challenge the argument's validity by focusing on existing details. Let me start with the endorsements. Are the numbers and sources of endorsements reliable? The text states ICE never endorsed anyone before. Maybe question the validity of that claim. For example, does ICE's past behavior support the claim that they've never endorsed anyone on immigration? That's in the text, so it's a good point.\n\nNext, he compares military endorsements to political hacks. Are these groups comparable? The question could ask if the comparison is valid, maybe pointing out differences in expertise between military leaders and political figures. That challenges the argument's logic.\n\nThen, there's the part about Russia. He says he doesn't think anyone knows it was Russia. The text mentions Clinton's agreement on cyber but his doubt. So, a question could ask if his uncertainty about Russia undermines his assertion about cybersecurity leadership. That ties his doubt to his capability claim.\n\nAvoiding unhelpful questions: Don't ask why endorsements matter because that's too general. Also, invalid questions would be about unrelated topics. Need to stay within the text's scope.\n\nSo, three questions could be:\n\n1. Does the claim that ICE has never endorsed anyone before on immigration hold true under scrutiny, and what evidence supports this assertion?\n2. How does the comparison between military endorsements and \"political hacks\" address the effectiveness of leadership without conflating military and political expertise?\n3. If Trump doubts the knowledge about Russia's involvement in the DNC breach, how does this uncertainty impact his credibility on cybersecurity leadership as he claims the need to be \"better than anybody else\"?\n\nWait, need to check if these questions are based on the text and not introducing new concepts. Let me adjust the third one to focus more on the contradiction between wanting to be better and doubting the knowledge. Maybe rephrase it to link his doubt to the assertion about being better.\n\nFinalizing the questions:\n\n- Does the assertion that ICE \"never endorsed anybody before on immigration\" hold true when considering past endorsements or official positions taken by the organization?  \n- How does comparing endorsements from military officials to \"political hacks\" substantiate the claim of superior leadership without conflating military and political expertise?  \n- If \"nobody knows\" if Russia breached the DNC, how does this uncertainty challenge Trump's assertion that the U.S. should be \"better than anybody else\" in cybersecurity?  \n\nThese questions target specific parts of the argument, challenge the validity by pointing out potential inconsistencies or unsubstantiated claims, and stay within the text's content."

AngelComa is defending the candidate by saying that the candidate has a plan on the website, can't talk about everything due to timed responses, and implies that people are used to politicians not having plans. The original comment by Punchee mocks the candidate's reference to the website as a weird moment.\n\nSo, the core arguments to challenge would be AngelComa's defense: the constraints of timed responses justifying referring to the website, the assumption that having a plan on the website is sufficient, and the comparison to other politicians not having plans.\n\nUseful questions should challenge these points.

He uses comparisons to countries like Dubai, China, etc., to highlight the poor state of U.S. airports.\n\nNow, to create useful questions that challenge the validity.

Those countries might have newer infrastructure, but maybe their contexts are different. So a question could ask about the validity of that comparison.\n\nAnother point: he mentions spending $6 trillion in the Middle East and says that money could've rebuilt the country twice. But does that $6 trillion equate to twice the cost of rebuilding? Where's the evidence for that? The report he mentions\u2014does it actually support that claim?\n\nHe also blames politicians like Clinton for causing the problem.

Does the comparison between U.S. airports and those in Dubai, Qatar, and China account for differences in governance or economic priorities that might affect infrastructure development?\n\n2. Is there evidence that the $6 trillion spent in the Middle East could realistically have funded the rebuilding of U.S. infrastructure twice, as claimed?\n\n3.

        "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text about the DOT's rule on bumping passengers. The goal is to challenge the argument's validity by focusing on details in the text without introducing new concepts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main arguments in the text. The citizen-s is arguing that the DOT should aim to eliminate all bumping, not just reduce it. They say bumping treats passengers as economic units and that compensation should have no cap, with penalties strong enough to prevent bumping entirely. They also propose specific compensation structures.\n\nNow, I need to identify potential weaknesses or assumptions in these arguments. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The assertion that eliminating bumping is the objective. Is that feasible? What if elimination isn't possible? The text doesn't address that. So a question could ask about the feasibility of total elimination versus reduction.\n\n2. The comparison of passengers to economic units. The text claims that bumping dehumanizes passengers. But is there evidence that treating them as economic units inherently leads to dehumanization? Maybe the link isn't established. A question could challenge that connection.\n\n3. The proposed compensation structure: 100% ticket price for delays under 2 hours, 200% or more otherwise. The text suggests this would eliminate bumping. But is there evidence that such penalties would actually deter airlines? Also, the text assumes higher compensation will prevent bumping, but maybe airlines would still find it cost-effective. A question could question the assumption that these penalties are sufficient.\n\nAlso, the text mentions that passengers should minimize costs with the airline's help. But how would the airline's \"good faith help\" be enforced? The text doesn't address potential conflicts of interest here. Maybe a question about the enforceability of that obligation.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure the questions don't introduce external concepts. Let's check the guidelines again. The questions must focus on existing details. So, for example, the first point about feasibility: the text states the objective is elimination. A question could ask whether the argument addresses the feasibility of eliminating all bumping, which is present in the text's goal.\n\nAnother angle: the text says there should be no cap on compensation. But if there's no cap, could that lead to unintended consequences like higher ticket prices? The text doesn't consider that. But the question can't introduce new concepts like ticket prices unless the text mentions them. The text doesn't, so maybe that's introducing a new concept. So avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, the text compares bumping to other aspects of airline behavior treating passengers as economic units. Is that comparison valid? The question could challenge the basis of that comparison.\n\nWait, in the example provided, one useful question was about comparing credit card ads to food products. So similarly, here, maybe the comparison of bumping to other airline behaviors as treating passengers as economic units. But the text doesn't elaborate on what those other aspects are. So a question could ask if the assumption that all such treatments are dehumanizing is valid, or if the analogy holds.\n\nAnother point: the text claims that bumping is purely economic. Is that accurate? Are there other factors, like operational issues, that lead to bumping? The text dismisses it as purely economic. A question could challenge that assumption by asking if the argument considers non-economic reasons for bumping.\n\nBut does the text mention non-economic reasons? No. So maybe that's introducing a new concept. Hmm. The question has to use details present. The text says \"purely economic device,\" so the question could challenge that characterization. For example, does the argument address possible non-economic factors that contribute to bumping, thereby weakening the claim that it's purely economic?\n\nWait, but if the text says it's purely economic, then questioning that would require evidence or reasoning within the text. But the text doesn't provide evidence for that claim. So a question could ask whether the argument provides evidence that bumping is solely an economic decision, which is present in the text's assertion.\n\nAlso, the proposed compensation includes the greater of 200% or out-of-pocket costs. The text assumes this will eliminate bumping, but maybe airlines could still find it cheaper to pay the compensation than avoid bumping. The question could ask if the argument demonstrates that these penalties are sufficient to eliminate bumping, rather than just assuming it.\n\nPutting this all together, here are possible useful questions:\n\n1. Does the argument provide evidence that eliminating bumping entirely is feasible, or does it assume feasibility without justification? (Challenges the core objective's feasibility.)\n\n2. Is the characterization of bumping as a \"purely economic device\" supported by evidence in the argument, or is it an unsupported assertion? (Targets the premise that it's purely economic.)\n\n3. How does the argument justify that the proposed compensation structure would eliminate bumping rather than merely reduce it, given that airlines might still find it economically viable? (Questions the link between penalties and elimination.)\n\nAlternatively, another angle: the text says passengers \"neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat.\" But overselling is a common practice; does the argument address why passengers don't deserve it beyond their preferences? Maybe the question could challenge the moral claim here.\n\nBut the guidelines say to avoid common sense. So maybe not. The text's main points are about the compensation structure and the objective to eliminate. So focusing on those aspects is better.\n\nI think the three questions I listed above fit the criteria. They each target specific parts of the argument, challenge the validity by questioning assumptions or evidence, and don't introduce new concepts outside the text."

The example they provided had questions that challenge the comparison between food warnings and credit card ads, check evidence for claims, and question hidden fees.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the text. The speaker is comparing regulations on food products (large warnings, no misleading claims) to a credit card offer that highlights 0% rates but has hidden charges in small print. They argue that this is irresponsible.\n\nSo, the core arguments here are the analogy between food regulations and financial ads, the effectiveness of the current regulations in preventing deception, and whether the credit card's presentation is misleading despite the small print.\n\nUseful questions should target these points. Let me brainstorm:\n\n1. The analogy: Is comparing food product regulations to financial ads valid? The speaker assumes that both situations are similar, but maybe there are differences in consumer behavior or regulation enforcement. So a question challenging the validity of this comparison.\n\n2. The small print: The text mentions that the charges are in small print but claims it's clear. However, the speaker says people are lured. Is there an assumption that small print is sufficient? Maybe a question about whether small print effectively communicates the true costs.\n\n3. The responsibility angle: The speaker implies that including information in small print isn't responsible. But they have all the info there. So a question could ask if the presence of small print absolves the company of responsibility, challenging the assumption that disclosure equals responsibility.\n\nAvoiding unhelpful ones like \"Why is it irresponsible?\" since that's already addressed. Also, no new concepts. Let me phrase these into questions following the examples.\n\nFirst question: How does the analogy between food product regulations and credit card advertisements hold up when considering differences in consumer awareness or regulatory standards? (This challenges the comparison's validity.)\n\nSecond: Does the use of small print for disclosing charges adequately prevent consumer deception, or does it rely on an assumption that consumers will read and understand the fine print? (Targets the effectiveness of small print.)\n\nThird: If all necessary information is technically provided, does the credit card company's presentation still shift responsibility onto the consumer for potential misunderstandings? (Challenges responsibility despite disclosure.)\n\nCheck guidelines: These are specific, target existing elements, don't introduce new concepts.

        "reasoning": "Okay, I need to generate three useful critical questions for the given text. Let me start by understanding the text first. The text is a dialogue where CL is challenging someone about taking advantage of people who can't negotiate and have no choice but to accept the terms. The main argument here seems to be that the party being addressed is exploiting vulnerable individuals by offering non-negotiable terms.\n\nNow, following the guidelines, the questions should challenge the argument's validity by focusing on details present without introducing new concepts. The examples provided in the prompt often ask about assumptions, evidence, or validity of comparisons. Let me brainstorm possible angles.\n\nFirst, the claim is that people have \"very little choice.\" A useful question might challenge the assumption that they truly have no alternatives. For example, asking whether it's proven that there are no other options. That would target the core of the argument.\n\nAnother point is \"taking advantage.\" The question could question the evidence that the terms are exploitative rather than just unfavorable. Maybe there's a lack of proof that the terms are unfair versus just being the only option available.\n\nAlso, the speaker assumes that having little choice automatically means being taken advantage of. A question could challenge if that link is justified. Like, does having no alternatives necessarily imply exploitation?\n\nLet me check if these fit the useful criteria. They focus on the text's existing points: lack of choice, taking advantage, and the connection between them. They don't introduce external ideas. They make the reader think about the validity of the premises. \n\nAvoiding unhelpful questions: I shouldn't ask something that's common sense or already answered. The text doesn't provide evidence, so asking for evidence is valid. Also, the comparison between choice and exploitation is core here.\n\nInvalid questions would be those introducing new concepts or being too vague. So sticking to the text's elements is key.\n\nSo, the three questions could be:\n\n1. What evidence supports the claim that individuals have \"very little choice,\" and does it account for potential alternatives not mentioned?\n2. How does the absence of negotiation options directly equate to being taken advantage of, and is this correlation justified?\n3. Is there data indicating that the offered terms are exploitative rather than simply the only available option in the current market?\n\nLet me check each against the guidelines. The first question asks about evidence for \"very little choice,\" which is central. The second questions the direct link between no negotiation and exploitation. The third asks for data on the nature of the terms. All target the argument's validity without introducing new concepts. They seem to fit the useful category."

What if other factors contributed to the drop?\n\nAnother point is her assertion that stop-and-frisk was ineffective because it was unconstitutional. Wait, the unconstitutionality might be separate from effectiveness. So maybe challenging whether the ruling against it was based on effectiveness or constitutional grounds. She conflates the two?\n\nAlso, she says community policing works, but how does she connect that to the crime statistics? Is there evidence that community policing caused the drop, or are there other factors? She might be assuming causation without proof.\n\nWhat about the mention of unintended consequences leading to incarceration for nonviolent offenses. She says \"we've had 25 years of cooperation,\" but if there were problems, how does she reconcile the cooperation with those negative outcomes? Maybe there's a contradiction there.\n\nSo possible questions:\n\n1. Does the constitutional ruling against stop-and-frisk necessarily prove its ineffectiveness, or were there other factors considered in the decision? (This challenges the link between unconstitutionality and effectiveness.)\n\n2. How does the comparison of current crime rates to 1991 account for changes in societal factors that may have influenced these statistics? (Questions the validity of the time frame chosen.)\n\n3.

But settling doesn't necessarily mean innocence. Questioning the assumption that settlement equals innocence could undermine his defense.\n\n3. **Use of specific examples**: The mention of sending pictures of Obama in certain garb (maybe referencing the birther controversy?) and the campaign manager's admission. Are these actions directly comparable to the current criticism Trump is facing? Also, does admitting the action (as per the campaign manager) validate Trump's claim, or is there more nuance?\n\nPossible questions:\n\n- Does the comparison between the opponent's past treatment of Obama and their current behavior effectively undermine their credibility, or is it a diversion from the current issues?\n- How does the lack of admission of guilt in the lawsuit settlement support the claim of innocence, given that settlements often avoid legal liability regardless of guilt?\n- Does the reference to the campaign manager's admission conclusively prove the opponent's hypocrisy, or could there be other interpretations of those past actions?\n\nI need to ensure each question is specific to the text, doesn't introduce new concepts, and challenges the argument's validity. Let me check the guidelines again to confirm. Avoid common sense, stay within the text, etc. These seem to fit. Let me rephrase them to be more concise and precise."

        "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to generate three useful critical questions for the given text about airlines and compensation. Let me read through the text carefully first.\n\nThe main argument here is that airlines shouldn't discriminate against passengers who paid lower fares or used miles because the airline is responsible for giving them seats. The author claims that without proper compensation, airlines have no incentive to schedule properly and might bump passengers for those who paid more, leading to hidden costs and unfair treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to find parts of the argument that can be challenged. The text compares airline practices to increasing ticket prices after purchase. Maybe I can question the validity of that analogy. Also, the author assumes that the airline's responsibility for giving seats means they shouldn't discriminate. Is there a logical connection there?\n\nAnother point is about hidden costs when being bumped. The text mentions these costs but doesn't provide evidence. So, a question could ask if those hidden costs are substantiated. Also, the claim that incentives based on compensation would ensure proper scheduling\u2014does that hold? Maybe the link between compensation and scheduling isn't proven.\n\nI need to make sure each question is grounded in the text and doesn't introduce new concepts. Let me draft some questions:\n\n1. Does the comparison between bumping passengers and increasing ticket prices post-purchase hold under scrutiny regarding contractual obligations? (Challenges the analogy's validity)\n\n2. Is there evidence provided that hidden costs incurred from being bumped significantly impact passengers, or is this an assumption? (Questions the basis of the claim about hidden costs)\n\n3. How does the argument establish that higher compensation directly incentivizes airlines to improve scheduling practices? (Challenges the cause-effect relationship)\n\nThese questions target specific parts of the argument, using what's present in the text. They don't ask for common knowledge or introduce external ideas. I need to check if they fit the guidelines. The first question tackles the analogy, the second the hidden costs evidence, and the third the incentive structure. Seems good.

The text is about banning nuts on airplanes, arguing that even if airlines don't serve nuts, passengers can still bring them, so all nuts should be banned except on private planes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the argument's core. The author claims that since airlines can't stop passengers from bringing nuts, a \"nut-free\" flight isn't effective, hence a total ban is needed. The key points are the inconsistency in policies and the effectiveness of a total ban.\n\nTo challenge validity, the questions should target the argument's assumptions or evidence. Let's see:\n\n1. The text compares allowing passengers to bring nuts to the ineffectiveness of a nut-free policy. A useful question could question the validity of this comparison. Maybe there's an assumption that passenger-brought nuts are as common or problematic as airline-served ones. So: \"Does the allowance of passengers bringing nuts inherently undermine the effectiveness of a 'nut-free' flight policy, or could there be mitigating factors?\" That makes the reader think if the presence of passenger nuts is a significant issue or if other factors reduce their impact.\n\n2. The argument assumes that a total ban would solve the problem. But enforcing such a ban might be difficult. So: \"What evidence supports the assertion that banning all nuts on commercial flights would be enforceable, given the current policies allowing personal food items?\" This challenges the feasibility, pointing out enforcement issues not addressed in the text.\n\n3. The conclusion that all nuts should be banned except on private planes might not follow logically. Maybe private planes are different, but the text doesn't explain why. So: \"Is the distinction between commercial and private planes in allowing nuts justified by differing risk levels or practical considerations?\" This questions the rationale behind the exception for private planes, which the text doesn't substantiate.\n\nI need to make sure each question targets specific parts of the argument without introducing new concepts. Avoid being too general or asking for common knowledge. The examples provided in the guidelines focus on validity of comparisons, evidence, and logical consistency. These questions fit that by addressing the comparison's validity, enforceability, and the private vs. commercial distinction."

Useful questions should focus on details in the text without introducing new concepts. Let's break it down.\n\nShe claims the US has \"much greater capacity.\" I can question the evidence for this claim. Is there support in the text? The question could ask if the assertion of greater capacity is supported by evidence, which challenges the validity.\n\nThen she says they don't want to use the tools they have. But she also says they will defend citizens. There's a possible contradiction here. So a question could ask about the contradiction between not wanting to use tools and defending citizens effectively. That would make the reader think if her stance is coherent.\n\nShe mentions that Russians are probing how far the US would go. Then she criticizes Trump for inviting Putin to hack. Maybe there's an assumption that public statements affect adversaries' actions. A question could ask if there's evidence that public statements like Trump's influence state actors' probing. That ties into the text's points without adding new concepts.\n\nAvoiding unhelpful questions: Don't ask why she thinks Trump's invitation is bad\u2014that's stated. Also, don't ask general things about cybersecurity. Need to stick to the text's arguments.\n\nSo the three questions would be:\n\n1.

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text. The text is a statement by Clinton discussing the economic recovery and contrasting her policies with Trump's, particularly on clean energy and climate change.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key arguments here. Clinton mentions the economic downturn, recovery, and warns against reverting to old policies. She cites independent experts validating her proposals. Then she moves to clean energy, positioning the U.S. as a potential superpower, and contrasts her stance on climate change with Trump's.\n\nUseful questions should challenge the validity without introducing new concepts. Let's break it down.\n\n1. The mention of independent experts: The user might question the independence or basis of these experts. So a question like, \"How do we know the experts are truly independent and unbiased?\" That challenges the credibility of her claim.\n\n2. She links past policies to the economic collapse. But correlation isn't causation. So, \"Is there evidence that the previous policies directly caused the economic issues?\" That questions the causal relationship she implies.\n\n3. She contrasts her clean energy stance with Trump's climate denial. The argument is that her approach is better. But does being a clean energy superpower depend on acknowledging climate change? Maybe not directly. So, \"Does dismissing climate change necessarily prevent leading in clean energy?\" This challenges the assumption in her argument.\n\nI need to make sure the questions don't ask for common knowledge or go outside the text. Also, avoid vague terms. Let me check the examples again. The sample questions in the example target specific comparisons, evidence, and hidden aspects.\n\nAnother point: Clinton says \"we're on the precipice of a better economy.\" A question could challenge the evidence for being on the precipice. But the text doesn't provide data, so maybe \"What evidence supports the claim that the economy is on the precipice of improvement?\" That's valid as it asks for support within her statement.\n\nWait, but does she provide any data here? She mentions the past problems and the recovery but not specific indicators. So the question would challenge the basis of her assertion about the precipice.\n\nAlternatively, the link between not reverting to old policies and avoiding past failures. The assumption is that the old policies caused the problems. So, \"Is there direct evidence that reverting to previous policies would repeat the economic collapse?\" That's similar to the causation question.\n\nI think the three I initially thought of fit the guidelines. Let me rephrase them to match the style in the examples.\n\n1. How does the assertion that independent experts validated the proposals establish their effectiveness without addressing potential biases or conflicts of interest?\n\nBut maybe more concise: \"What evidence confirms the independence of the experts evaluating the proposals, and could their biases affect their conclusions?\" Hmm, perhaps better to simplify. \"Does the endorsement by independent experts account for potential biases or conflicts of interest that could affect their analysis?\" But the example questions are more direct. Let's see the sample useful questions: \"What is the basis for comparing...\" So maybe \"What evidence supports the claim that independent experts' evaluations of the proposals are free from bias?\" But the text doesn't mention bias, so maybe it's introducing a new concept. Wait, the user's guidelines say to focus on details present. The text says \"Independent experts have looked at what I\u2019ve proposed, looked at what Donald\u2019s proposed.\" The question could challenge the validity by questioning the independence. So the first question could be: \"What criteria determine the independence of the experts cited, and how does this ensure their assessments are unbiased?\" But maybe too wordy. Alternatively: \"How does the reference to 'independent experts' substantiate the superiority of Clinton's proposals over Donald's without examining their methodology?\" That's better. It challenges the reliance on experts without knowing their methods.\n\nSecond, the causation between past policies and economic collapse. So: \"Is there direct evidence linking the previous policies to the economic collapse, or is this a correlation without proven causation?\" That's good.\n\nThird, the clean energy point: \"Does Donald\u2019s belief in climate change as a hoax inherently negate the possibility of advancing clean energy initiatives under his policies?\" Wait, the text says Trump thinks it's a hoax, Clinton thinks it's real. She implies that her stance is necessary for clean energy leadership. So the question could challenge if that's necessarily true. \"Does dismissing climate change as a hoax necessarily prevent a country from becoming a clean-energy superpower, or can technological advancement occur independently of climate beliefs?\" That's a bit long. Maybe: \"Can a country become a clean-energy superpower without acknowledging climate change, thereby challenging the necessity of Clinton\u2019s stance?\" But the text says \"Some country is going to be...\" So the question is whether Trump's stance (climate as hoax) would prevent the US from being that superpower. So the question could be: \"Is the acknowledgment of climate change a necessary factor in becoming a clean-energy superpower, or could technological investments proceed regardless of climate beliefs?\" That's better.\n\nSo the three questions would be:\n\n1. How does the endorsement by independent experts validate the effectiveness of the proposed policies without examining their potential biases or methodologies?\n\n2. Is there conclusive evidence that reverting to previous policies would reinitiate economic collapse, or is this an assumption based on correlation?\n\n3. Can technological advancements in clean energy be achieved independently of acknowledging climate change, thereby challenging the necessity of Clinton\u2019s proposed approach?\n\nWait, but the third question introduces \"technological advancements\" which might not be in the text. The text says \"clean-energy superpower\". So maybe rephrase: \"Does a country's stance on climate change directly determine its ability to lead in clean energy, or can other factors compensate?\" That's better. It stays within the text's content.\n\nAlternatively, \"Is the claim that dismissing climate change hinders becoming a clean-energy superpower supported by evidence, or can such leadership be achieved through other means?\" \n\nHmm. Need to make sure it's concise and directly challenges the argument. Maybe: \"Does the dismissal of climate change as a hoax inherently prevent the development of clean energy initiatives, or can they coexist independently?\" \n\nYes, that's better. It questions the link Clinton implies between acknowledging climate change and leading in clean energy.\n\nSo final three questions:\n\nWhat evidence substantiates the independence and objectivity of the experts evaluating the competing proposals?\n\nIs there direct causation established between the previous policies and the economic collapse, or is the connection merely correlational?\n\nDoes the rejection of climate change science necessarily impede a country's ability to become a leader in clean energy technology?"

First, I need to understand the text's main argument. The author is saying that current airline practices are a \"race to the bottom,\" harming both passengers and profits. They argue that external regulations are necessary to level the playing field, leading to better service and fair competition.\n\nNow, following the guidelines, the questions should challenge the argument's validity without introducing new concepts. Let's break down the argument. The key claims are: 1) external regulations are needed, 2) these regulations will level the playing field, 3) this will result in better service and fair competition, and 4) the regulations are in the best interests of both airlines and passengers.\n\nFor the first question, maybe challenge the assumption that regulations will automatically benefit both parties. The text says \"best interests of both,\" but is there evidence that airlines would benefit? Maybe they could face higher costs or other issues. So a question like: \"How does imposing regulations ensure mutual benefit for airlines and passengers when airlines might resist increased costs?\"\n\nSecond, the text compares airline competition to a \"race to the bottom.\" Is this comparison valid? The author uses the term but doesn't provide evidence that it's a race to the bottom. So: \"What evidence supports the claim that airline competition is a 'race to the bottom,' and does this analogy hold under scrutiny?\"\n\nThird, the argument assumes that leveling the playing field will remove the need for cost-cutting. But maybe airlines could still find other ways to cut costs, or the regulations might not address all areas. So: \"Does leveling the competitive field through regulations eliminate all incentives for airlines to reduce costs, or could alternative cost-cutting measures emerge?\"\n\nCheck if these questions are specific, challenge the core arguments, and don't introduce external ideas. They should focus on existing points in the text. Avoid being too general or asking for common knowledge. These seem to fit. Alright, I think these are the three useful questions."

So her point is that the proposals (presumably from someone else) don't include these changes, yet she's in favor of repatriation.\n\nNow, useful questions should challenge the validity of her argument. Let's break it down. She mentions not seeing changes in the tax proposals that would lead to repatriation. So maybe there's an assumption that corporate tax rate changes are necessary for repatriation. A question could ask if that link is established. For example, does the lack of rate changes necessarily mean repatriation won't happen? Maybe other factors could influence it.\n\nAnother angle: she supports repatriation but doesn't see the proposals causing it. So is there evidence that her support alone would lead to repatriation without the specific tax changes? That challenges the connection between her support and the outcome.\n\nThird, she differentiates between her support and the proposals. Maybe she's implying that the proposals are inadequate. But does the text provide evidence that the proposals are insufficient for repatriation? That questions whether her critique is justified based on the information given.\n\nI need to make sure each question is based on the text, not introducing outside concepts.

Howie is dismissing the severity of food allergies, claiming they're overblown and even suggesting Munchausen by Proxy. Jsooudi, as a physician and mother, shares her son's severe allergies and the challenges they face, especially during flights.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main arguments. Howie argues that food allergies are exaggerated, allergists are pseudoscientists, and implies the mother might be fabricating the condition. Jsooudi provides detailed evidence of her son's severe reactions and the lack of airline accommodations.\n\nNow, to generate useful questions that challenge Howie's arguments. The questions should focus on existing details without introducing new concepts. Let me check the examples given earlier. The useful questions there targeted the comparison made in the text, evidence for claims, and hidden fees.\n\nFirst, Howie questions the existence of life-threatening allergies, saying he doubts people actually die from peanut exposure. But jsooudi mentions her son's severe reactions and knowing others who can't fly. A question could challenge Howie's skepticism by pointing to the evidence provided.\n\nSecond, Howie compares allergists to pseudoscientists and claims they're not doctors. Jsooudi is a physician herself, so maybe a question about Howie's basis for discrediting allergists, given that medical professionals recognize them.\n\nThird, Howie suggests Munchausen by Proxy, implying the mother is causing harm for attention. But jsooudi is a physician and provides specific medical details. A question could ask if Howie's accusation is supported by evidence in her account.\n\nAlso, Howie claims most kids outgrow allergies by 5. Jsooudi's son is 4, so maybe a question on whether Howie's dismissal considers ongoing severe cases beyond that age.\n\nI need to ensure the questions don't introduce new ideas. Let me check each guideline. Avoid common sense, too general, etc.\n\nPossible questions:\n\n1. How does Howie reconcile his claim that \"almost no one is actually that allergic\" with the detailed medical evidence provided by jsooudi regarding her son's life-threatening reactions?\n\nThis targets Howie's dismissal versus the evidence given.\n\n2. What evidence does Howie provide to support his assertion that allergists are \"pseudoscientists\" and not real doctors, especially when jsooudi identifies herself as a physician relying on medical professionals?\n\nChallenges the basis for discrediting allergists, using the text's info.\n\n3. Does Howie's suggestion of Munchausen by Proxy account for the documented medical history and emergency interventions described by jsooudi, or does it dismiss verified health risks without substantiation?\n\nQuestions the validity of the Munchausen accusation against the provided evidence.\n\nAnother angle: Howie's claim that kids outgrow allergies by 5. Since jsooudi's son is 4, but she mentions ongoing severe issues. Maybe a question on whether Howie's generalization ignores persistent severe cases.\n\nBut the third question I have now covers the Munchausen angle. Let me check if these are valid. They should focus on existing details and challenge the argument's validity. Yes, each question references specific parts of the text and challenges Howie's claims using the evidence provided by jsooudi. They don't introduce new concepts. Avoid being too general.

Let's start by understanding the text.\n\nFirst, Trump claims he has better judgment and temperament. He mentions that Clinton spent a lot on ads, using Madison Avenue to focus on temperament. He asserts his temperament is his strongest asset and that Clinton was \"out of control\" in a conversation with AFL-CIO. \n\nNow, the goal is to challenge the validity of his arguments. Useful questions should target the core of his claims without introducing new concepts. Let's break down his points.\n\nHe compares his temperament to Clinton's but doesn't provide evidence. So a question could ask about the evidence supporting his assertion. Also, he uses Madison Avenue as part of the attack on her; maybe the analogy's validity is questionable. Then, the AFL-CIO comment is a specific example where he says she was out of control, but he admits he doesn't know who she was talking to. That seems contradictory\u2014how can he judge her temperament in that situation without context?\n\nPotential questions:\n\n1. How does Trump substantiate his claim of superior temperament without providing specific examples? (Challenges evidence for his assertion.)\n2. Does equating Clinton's ad spending with Madison Avenue tactics logically undermine her temperament? (Questions the validity of the comparison.)\n3. Can Trump's criticism of Clinton's AFL-CIO interaction be valid if he lacks knowledge of the context? (Targets the contradiction in his argument.)\n\nI need to make sure these questions don't introduce external ideas and stay focused on the text. Let me check the examples given earlier. The first example's useful questions focus on comparisons and evidence. So these questions align with that approach. They challenge the core arguments by pointing out lack of evidence, questionable analogies, and contradictions."

        "reasoning": "Okay, I need to generate three useful critical questions for the given text about banning peanuts on airlines. Let me start by understanding the text. The author, a physician and allergy expert, argues for a full ban on peanuts in all flights. Her main points are that peanut reactions can be life-threatening through contact or inhalation, residue is a problem even on restricted flights, buffer zones are impractical, and there are plenty of other food options. She also cites her credentials and her support forum with 3000 members.\n\nFirst, I should look for the core arguments. She claims that buffer zones don't work practically. So a question could challenge the assumption that buffer zones are ineffective. Maybe ask if there's evidence that buffer zones fail despite being a thoughtful gesture. That's present in the text.\n\nAnother point is about residue being rampant even on restricted flights. The author states that restricting to certain flights isn't enough because residue remains. So, is there data showing residue persists across all flights, or is this an assumption? That could question the validity of her claim about residue.\n\nThird, she mentions many food choices available, implying peanuts aren't necessary. A question here could ask if alternatives are equally feasible for airlines in terms of cost, availability, etc., which the text doesn't address. But wait, the guidelines say to avoid introducing new concepts. The text says there are many choices, but does she provide evidence that peanuts are uniquely replaceable without downsides? So maybe question whether availability of other foods necessarily makes peanuts unnecessary, considering factors the author hasn't addressed.\n\nAlso, her credentials and support forum are used to bolster her argument. A question could ask if her forum's size (3000 members) is representative of the allergic community's views, challenging the assumption that her group's stance is the majority.\n\nWait, but the first example in the guidelines asks about comparisons made in the text. Here, the author compares buffer zones to a ban. The questions should focus on existing arguments. Let me check each guideline again.\n\nUseful questions should challenge the argument's validity by focusing on details in the text. So:\n\n1. Buffer zones are called thoughtful but impractical. The author claims they don't work, but is there evidence provided for why they fail? The text doesn't give specific reasons, so the question would ask for that evidence.\n\n2. Residue being rampant on flights even when restricted. The text says restricting to certain flights isn't enough because residue remains. But is there data proving residue is a widespread issue across all flights, or is that an assumption?\n\n3. The availability of many food choices making peanuts unnecessary. The author presents this as a given, but does she address possible reasons airlines might still need peanuts, like cost or passenger preference? The question would challenge the necessity by asking if alternatives are as viable without negative impact, based on the text's claims.\n\nAnother angle: The author's authority as a physician and having a support forum. Does having 3000 members mean the forum's opinions are representative? The question could ask if that sample size is sufficient to generalize for all allergic individuals, but that might be introducing external ideas about statistical representation. Maybe better to stick to arguments within the text.\n\nAlternatively, the author states that reactions can happen without consumption. The text mentions contact or inhalation. Is there evidence provided that these non-consumption reactions are common enough on flights to warrant a ban? The text doesn't cite specific incidents, so a question could ask for that evidence.\n\nWait, but the example questions in the original example focused on comparing to food products, evidence for claims, and hidden fees. Similarly, here, the author makes several claims without providing specific evidence. So useful questions would challenge the evidence behind those claims.\n\nSo possible useful questions:\n\n1. Is there evidence provided that buffer zones, despite being a thoughtful gesture, are impractical in real-world airline settings? (Challenges the practical failure claim.)\n\n2. Does the author provide data showing peanut residue remains problematic on flights even when peanut products are restricted to certain routes? (Questions the residue claim.)\n\n3. Are the available alternative food options mentioned by the author equally feasible for airlines in terms of cost and passenger preference, or does the argument overlook potential challenges? (This might introduce new concepts like cost and preference, which aren't in the text. The text only says there are many choices. So maybe rephrase to focus on the necessity: Does the availability of many food choices necessarily make peanuts unnecessary, and does the argument address why peanuts specifically should be banned over other allergens?)\n\nWait, the text says \"With so many food choices available, why are peanuts a necessary choice?\" So the author assumes peanuts aren't necessary. A question could challenge that assumption by asking if the argument considers reasons airlines might still require peanuts despite alternatives, but the text doesn't mention any such reasons, so maybe the question is valid as it's based on the text's claim.\n\nAlternatively, the question could be: Does the argument consider potential reasons airlines continue to offer peanuts despite other food options, or does it assume their necessity without justification?\n\nBut the user's guidelines say to avoid introducing new concepts. So perhaps better to ask: Does the availability of alternative food options sufficiently justify a full ban on peanuts, or are there unaddressed reasons peanuts might still be preferred by airlines?\n\nBut maybe that's introducing new ideas. Alternatively, the text's question is \"why are peanuts a necessary choice?\" implying they aren't. So a useful question could be: Is the assumption that peanuts are unnecessary supported by evidence about airline food choices and passenger preferences, or is it presented as self-evident?\n\nBut passenger preferences aren't in the text. The text only states that many choices exist. So maybe: Does the author provide evidence that peanuts are not a necessary choice for airlines given other available foods, or is this assertion based solely on the existence of alternatives?\n\nYes, that's challenging the link between availability of alternatives and necessity of peanuts. The author assumes that because alternatives exist, peanuts aren't needed, but maybe there are reasons airlines choose peanuts (like cost, shelf-life, etc.) that aren't addressed. The question stays within the text's mention of many choices and necessity, without introducing external factors, just questioning the sufficiency of the reasoning.\n\nSo compiling these, the three questions could be:\n\n1. Is there evidence provided that buffer zones are impractical, or is this assumption based solely on the author's assertion?\n\n2. Does the author substantiate the claim that peanut residue remains rampant on flights with restricted peanut usage, or is this presented without data?\n\n3. Does the argument demonstrate that the availability of other food choices inherently makes peanuts unnecessary, or does it overlook potential reasons for their continued use?\n\nThese questions target specific parts of the text, challenge the evidence or assumptions, and don't introduce external concepts."

        "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to generate three useful critical questions for the given text. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand the arguments presented.\n\nThe text is a statement by Clinton, discussing Donald's support for the Iraq invasion, his advocacy for actions in Libya, and the claim that George W. Bush, not Obama, set the timeline for troop withdrawal from Iraq. Clinton asserts these points as proven and mentions that the Iraqi government wouldn't agree to protect U.S. troops, hence why they couldn't stay.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main arguments here. Clinton is challenging Donald's positions on military actions and attributing the troop withdrawal timeline to Bush. She also brings up Libya and Gadhafi. The key claims are that Donald supported the Iraq invasion, advocated for Libya actions, and that Bush, not Obama, decided the troop exit.\n\nNow, to create useful questions, I should target these claims. The questions should challenge the validity without introducing new concepts. Let's break down each part.\n\n1. \"Donald supported the invasion of Iraq... absolutely proved over and over again.\" A useful question might question the evidence behind this proof. For example, does the text provide specific instances or sources for this proof?\n\n2. The comparison between Bush and Obama regarding the troop withdrawal. Clinton says Bush made the agreement, not Obama, and the Iraqi government wouldn't protect troops. A question here could challenge the assumption that Bush's agreement was the only factor, or if other factors under Obama's administration influenced the withdrawal.\n\n3. Mention of Donald advocating for Libya actions and urging Gadhafi's removal after doing business with him. Here, a question could address the implied conflict of interest. Does the text provide evidence that his business dealings influenced his advocacy?\n\nI also need to avoid common sense or unhelpful questions. For instance, asking \"Did Donald support the Iraq invasion?\" would be unhelpful because it's stated. Instead, digging into the evidence or assumptions behind the claims is better.\n\nAnother angle: The text says the Iraqi government would not agree to protect U.S. troops. Is there an assumption here that no alternatives were possible? Or that the Iraqi government's refusal was the sole reason, ignoring other potential factors?\n\nFor the Libya part, the mention of doing business with Gadhafi before advocating his removal might imply a contradiction or ulterior motive. A question could ask if the text connects the business dealings to his advocacy, and if that connection is substantiated.\n\nAlso, the claim that Bush's agreement is the reason troops left\u2014does the text consider any decisions or actions by Obama's administration that might have affected the timeline?\n\nPutting this together, the three questions could be:\n\n1. Does the text provide specific evidence that Donald's support for the Iraq invasion was \"absolutely proved,\" or is this assertion presented without substantiation?\n\n2. What evidence supports the claim that the Iraqi government's refusal to protect U.S. troops was the sole reason for withdrawal, and were there alternative solutions considered?\n\n3. Is there a demonstrated connection in the text between Donald's past business with Gadhafi and his advocacy for military action in Libya, or is this implied without evidence?\n\nThese questions target the core arguments, challenge their validity by probing into evidence and assumptions, and don't introduce external concepts. They make the reader reflect on whether the claims are well-supported or if there are gaps in the reasoning."

        "reasoning": "Okay, I need to generate three useful critical questions for this Trump text. Let me start by understanding the argument here. Trump is arguing that Hillary Clinton doesn't have the stamina or the \"look\" to be president, and that her experience is bad, specifically mentioning the Iran deal. \n\nFirst, I should look for the main claims. The key points are stamina, presidential look, and bad experience (Iran deal). The useful questions need to challenge these points based on the text without introducing new concepts.\n\nFor stamina: Trump repeats that she lacks stamina. A useful question might challenge the criteria for stamina. How does he define it? The text mentions negotiating trade deals, defending Saudi Arabia, etc. So maybe question the link between those tasks and stamina.\n\nPresidential look: He mentions \"look\" but doesn't explain. A question about how look is defined and its relevance to presidential duties.\n\nBad experience: He cites the Iran deal giving $150 billion. A question could ask about evidence that the deal was bad, or if other factors influenced that outcome.\n\nAvoid questions that are too general or common sense. For example, asking \"Is stamina important for a president?\" is too obvious. Instead, focus on the connection between the examples given and the claims made.\n\nSo potential questions:\n\n1. How does Trump define \"the presidential look,\" and is there evidence that this criterion is relevant to effective leadership? (Challenges the vague term \"look\" and its relevance.)\n\n2. What specific evidence does Trump provide to support the claim that Clinton's experience is \"bad,\" beyond referencing the Iran deal? (Questions the basis of the \"bad experience\" claim beyond a single example.)\n\n3. Does the assertion that Clinton lacks stamina account for her previous roles requiring sustained effort, such as Secretary of State? (Challenges the stamina claim by considering her past roles, which are implied in the text when he mentions her experience.)\n\nWait, but the text doesn't explicitly mention her role as Secretary of State. The user said to focus on details present. Hmm. The text does mention her experience in the Iran deal, which is part of her role. So maybe rephrase to focus on the Iran deal example.\n\nAlternatively: How does the Iran deal example conclusively demonstrate that Clinton's experience is detrimental, rather than other factors? (Challenges the link between the deal and her experience being bad.)\n\nOr maybe: Is the $150 billion cited in the Iran deal an accurate representation of its impact, and does this alone justify labeling her experience as \"bad\"? (Questions the evidence provided.)\n\nI need to make sure the questions don't introduce new concepts. The third question I thought of earlier might bring in her Secretary role, which isn't in the text. So better to stick to the Iran deal and the examples he gives.\n\nSo revised questions:\n\n1. How does Trump substantiate the claim that stamina is a necessary trait for negotiating trade deals, and is there evidence that Clinton lacks this specific ability? (Links stamina to the tasks mentioned.)\n\n2. What criteria define \"the presidential look,\" and how is this standard applied consistently to other political figures? (Challenges the vagueness of \"look\".)\n\n3. Does the example of the Iran deal sufficiently demonstrate that Clinton's experience is detrimental, considering potential external factors influencing the deal's outcome? (Questions the basis of the bad experience claim.)\n\nCheck guidelines: Each question should challenge the argument's validity using text details. These seem to fit. Avoid unhelpful or invalid ones. The first question links stamina to negotiation, which he mentions. The second tackles \"look.\" The third focuses on the Iran deal example. They don't introduce external concepts but use what's in the text."

He makes several claims: 1) His tax cut is the biggest since Reagan. 2) Cutting regulations is most appreciated by businesses. 3) Opponent's policies will increase taxes and regulations, harming businesses.\n\nFor the first question, I can question the comparison to Reagan's tax cuts. The text says \"biggest since Ronald Reagan,\" but does that account for inflation or economic context? That's a valid challenge.\n\nSecond, he says businesses care most about regulation cuts. Is there evidence provided that this is their top priority over other factors like taxes or market conditions? The text doesn't provide data, so questioning the basis of this claim makes sense.\n\nThird, he claims the opponent's regulations will drive businesses out. But does increasing regulations always lead to business closures? Maybe some regulations help, or businesses adapt. The text assumes causation without evidence.\n\nAvoiding unhelpful questions like \"Why does Trump think his tax cut is good?\" which is too general. Also, not introducing external ideas like specific economic theories. Each question must target the existing arguments and challenge their validity based on what's present."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text by Clinton. The goal is to challenge the validity of her arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the text. Clinton is talking about sharing profits beyond executives, supporting work-family balance, paid leave, affordable childcare, debt-free college. She says funding will come from making the wealthy pay their fair share and closing corporate loopholes. She also mentions the debate with Trump and earning votes.\n\nNow, applying the guidelines. The questions should focus on existing details, not introduce new concepts. They should make the reader reflect on the argument's weaknesses.\n\nLooking at her claims: \"wealthy pay fair share\" and \"close corporate loopholes\" as funding sources. Possible issues: Are these sufficient? How does she define \"fair share\"? Are the plans feasible?\n\nAnother point is the connection between sharing profits and executives. She says people who help create profits should share. But how does that translate into policy? Does she assume that current systems don't allow this, or is there evidence that current profit-sharing is inadequate?\n\nAlso, she lists several policies (paid leave, sick days, childcare, college). Are these all addressed by the same funding source? Is there a prioritization, or might some require more resources than others?\n\nPotential questions:\n1. How does Clinton define \"fair share\" for the wealthy, and is there evidence this will cover all proposed programs?\n2. Does the assumption that closing corporate loopholes alone can fund these initiatives ignore potential economic impacts?\n3. How will profit-sharing beyond executives be implemented without disincentivizing corporate investment?\n\nCheck if these are too vague or introduce new ideas. The first question targets the funding mechanism's sufficiency. The second questions the feasibility and unintended consequences. The third addresses the practicality of profit-sharing. All are based on the text's claims without adding external concepts.\n\nAvoiding unhelpful questions like \"Why is family leave important?\" which is too obvious. Also, no invalid ones like introducing unrelated economic theories."

        "reasoning": "Okay, I need to generate three useful critical questions for this text about a child with severe allergies and the parents' concerns. Let me start by understanding the main arguments here. The parent is arguing that their child's peanut allergy is a disability because it severely limits their ability to travel, especially flying, due to airborne particles. They mention the unpredictability of reactions, the short duration of EpiPen effectiveness, and the risk in future scenarios like a job requiring flights.\n\nFirst, I should look for claims that can be challenged. For example, the parent compares the allergy to a disability. So, a useful question might challenge the basis of that comparison. Maybe ask if there's evidence that all airborne exposures on planes are unavoidable, which would test the validity of the disability claim.\n\nNext, the text says EpiPens only last 15 minutes. Is there an assumption here that no other interventions exist? A question could ask if the argument overlooks other medical measures that might extend safety beyond 15 minutes.\n\nAnother point is the unpredictability of reactions. The parent states the first reaction could be mild, the second severe. Does this assume that all subsequent exposures will be worse? Maybe question whether the argument accounts for cases where reactions don't escalate, which could weaken the claim about inevitable life-threatening risks.\n\nI should avoid questions that are too general or introduce new concepts. Also, make sure each question is rooted in the text's details. Let me check the guidelines again. The questions need to challenge the argument's validity by focusing on existing points without bringing in external ideas.\n\nSo, possible questions:\n\n1. Does the comparison of peanut allergy to a disability account for measures airlines take to prevent airborne exposure, or is the risk presented as inevitable without such context? (Challenges the disability claim by questioning if all risks are unavoidable.)\n\n2. Is there evidence that EpiPens are the sole medical intervention available during flights, or does the argument overlook potential complementary treatments or protocols? (Questions the reliance on EpiPen alone, maybe other measures exist.)\n\n3. Does the argument assume that all subsequent allergic reactions will necessarily escalate in severity, and are there documented cases where reactions remain manageable without life-threatening outcomes? (Challenges the unpredictability claim by suggesting maybe not all reactions escalate.)\n\nWait, the third question might be introducing documented cases, which is external. Maybe rephrase to focus on the text's assumption. Like: Does the argument's emphasis on the unpredictability of peanut allergy reactions account for instances where subsequent exposures do not result in increased severity, thereby challenging the inevitability of life-threatening outcomes?\n\nHmm, maybe better to phrase without bringing in external evidence. Focus on the assumption in the text. Let me adjust.\n\nAnother angle: The parent mentions future job scenarios requiring flights. Does the argument assume that no alternative accommodations (like remote work) are possible, thereby overstating the necessity of risking life for employment?\n\nBut that might be introducing new concepts (alternative accommodations) not in the text. The text doesn't mention possible job accommodations, so maybe that's invalid.\n\nStick to the existing points. The main arguments are about the inevitability of exposure on flights, EpiPen's limitations, and the disability classification.\n\nI think the first three questions I thought of are okay, but need to ensure they don't introduce external ideas. Let me check again.\n\nFirst question: Asks if the comparison to disability considers airline measures. The text mentions \"peanut particles circulated through the cabin and possible no place to land for hours.\" So the text does mention the cabin environment but doesn't say if airlines have prevention measures. The question is challenging whether the argument acknowledges existing measures, which is valid because if airlines do have protocols, the risk might be lower than presented.\n\nSecond question: Asks if EpiPens are the only intervention. The text says \"An EpiPen only last 15 minutes.\" The argument assumes that after 15 minutes, there's no recourse. If there are other measures, the argument's validity is weakened. But the text doesn't mention other measures, so the question is pointing out an assumption in the argument.\n\nThird question: The text says reactions are unpredictable, first mild, second severe. The question challenges if the argument accounts for cases where reactions don't escalate. Since the text presents escalation as a possibility, but maybe not a certainty, the question asks if the argument overstates the inevitability.\n\nThese seem to fit the guidelines. They challenge the argument's validity by targeting its assumptions and existing points without adding new concepts."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given Trump quote. First, I need to understand the argument in the text. Trump is saying that Clinton and others should have been addressing economic issues years ago, implying that their failure led to the current debt and economic problems. He claims credit for creating a movement now.\n\nThe guidelines say the questions should challenge the argument's validity without introducing new concepts. So, I need to find points where the logic might be weak. Let's break down the elements of his argument.\n\nHe mentions owing $20 trillion and connects that to the inaction of others. But does he provide evidence that their inaction directly caused the debt? That's a possible angle. Also, he says \"we've created a movement\"\u2014but how does creating a movement address the economic issues he's talking about? There's a gap there. Also, he blames others for not acting sooner, but is there an assumption that their actions would have prevented the problems? Maybe he's not considering other factors.\n\nSo, possible questions:\n\n1. Does Trump provide evidence that Clinton's inaction directly caused the $20 trillion debt, or is there a correlation without causation? This challenges the link between the two.\n\n2. How does creating a movement address the specific economic issues mentioned, like the debt? Questions the effectiveness of his solution.\n\n3. Does the argument consider other factors contributing to the economic problems besides politicians' inaction? This points out potential overlooked causes.\n\nI need to make sure these questions are based solely on the text and don't bring in external ideas. Also, avoid being too general. Let me check against the examples. The useful questions in the example targeted specific comparisons and evidence. These questions seem to fit the criteria. They challenge the core reasoning without being too broad or introducing new concepts."
