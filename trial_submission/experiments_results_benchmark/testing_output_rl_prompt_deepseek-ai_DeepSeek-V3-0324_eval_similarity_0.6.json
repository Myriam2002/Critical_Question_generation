The text makes several claims about the state of the U.S. infrastructure, debt, and spending, while attributing blame to politicians like Secretary Clinton. Useful questions should probe the evidence, assumptions, and logical consistency of these claims without introducing external concepts or being overly general.\n\n1. **Evidence for airport comparisons**: Trump compares U.S. airports unfavorably to those in Dubai, Qatar, and China. A useful question would challenge whether this comparison is fair or representative, as it could weaken his argument if the comparison is selective or exaggerated.\n   \n2. **Causation and blame**: Trump blames politicians like Clinton for the debt and infrastructure problems. A useful question would ask whether he provides evidence linking their policies directly to these issues, as this could reveal a lack of causal reasoning.\n   \n3. **Consistency in spending claims**: Trump mentions spending $6 trillion in the Middle East and claims it could have rebuilt the country twice. A useful question would challenge the basis of this calculation, as it might expose oversimplification or lack of supporting data.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nHow does the comparison of U.S. airports to those in Dubai, Qatar, and China account for differences in funding, scale, or purpose, and is this comparison fair or representative?\nWhat specific policies or actions by Secretary Clinton does Trump cite as directly causing the $20 trillion debt and infrastructure problems, and is there evidence to support this causation?\nOn what basis does Trump calculate that $6 trillion spent in the Middle East could have rebuilt the U.S. twice, and does this account for the actual costs of such projects?\n</answer>",
