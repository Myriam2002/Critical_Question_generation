The text makes claims about Hillary Clinton's stamina and appearance as disqualifying factors for the presidency, but it doesn't provide evidence to support these subjective judgments. A useful question would challenge the basis for these claims.\n2. The text asserts that Clinton's experience is \"bad experience\" and cites the Iran deal as an example, but it doesn't explain why the deal is inherently bad or how it reflects on her overall competence. A useful question would probe the validity of this generalization.\n3. The text conflates stamina and appearance with the ability to negotiate trade deals and defend countries, but it doesn't establish a clear connection between these traits. A useful question would challenge the logical link between these ideas.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nWhat evidence supports the claim that Hillary Clinton lacks the stamina or \"look\" required to be president, and how are these qualities objectively measured?\nHow does the Iran deal specifically demonstrate \"bad experience,\" and why does this negate all of Clinton's other experience?\nWhy is stamina or appearance relevant to the ability to negotiate trade deals or defend allies, and what specific failures in these areas does Clinton have?\n</answer>",
