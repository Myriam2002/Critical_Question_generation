The argument hinges on the claim that peanuts pose a significant safety risk due to severe allergic reactions. To critically evaluate this claim, students should assess:  \n- How common severe peanut allergies are among air travelers (prevalence).  \n- How frequently allergic reactions actually occur on planes due to peanuts (incidence).  \n\nIf the prevalence and incidence are very low, the argument\u2019s strength diminishes, as the risk may not justify the policy change. Conversely, if the numbers are high, the argument gains credibility. Thus, this question encourages critical analysis of the evidence supporting the intervention.",

The speaker's core argument is that a *complete ban* is necessary because existing measures (like nut-free zones or airline policies) are ineffective. Asking whether airlines could implement *other* measures does not challenge the validity of the speaker's claim that current solutions are insufficient and that a ban is the only viable option. Instead, it shifts focus to hypothetical alternatives, which the speaker has already dismissed implicitly by arguing that partial measures fail.  \n\nAdditionally, the answer to this question would likely involve speculation rather than critical engagement with the speaker's reasoning. The text already implies that alternative measures (e.g., nut-free zones, cleaning protocols) do not work, so proposing further alternatives does not advance the analysis.  \n\nThus, while the question is not *invalid* (it is relevant to the topic), it is *unhelpful* for critically evaluating the argument. A more useful question would directly address the speaker's claims, such as:  \n- *How does the speaker justify the claim that a complete ban is the only effective solution, given that some airlines already have partial restrictions?*  \n- *Is the comparison between nut allergies and other food allergies (where avoidance is easier) a strong basis for advocating a ban?*  \n\nThese would better prompt critical reflection on the argument's validity.",

It is also not *invalid* because it is directly related to the text and challenges a specific argument.)",
