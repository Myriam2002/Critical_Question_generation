A question could probe whether the author\u2019s stance unfairly shifts responsibility onto passengers.\n3. **Implication Exploration**: The text suggests notifications could cause more harm than good. A question could ask whether the potential benefits of transparency (e.g., trust-building) outweigh the risks mentioned.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nDoes the author provide evidence that passengers' reactions to delay notifications are typically irrational or harmful?\nHow does the author reconcile the unpredictability of delays with the expectation that passengers should simply accept them without complaint?\nAre there alternative ways to implement delay notifications that could mitigate the risks the author describes while still providing transparency?\n</answer>",

My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.\nI am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.\nIf I eat a peanut I'll get sick.\nI ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.\nIt was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.\nI would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.\nEverybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.\"\"",
