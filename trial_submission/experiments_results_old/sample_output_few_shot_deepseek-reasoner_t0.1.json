The main points are about building an economy that works for everyone, creating new jobs in various sectors, raising the minimum wage, equal pay for women, and profit-sharing.\n\nFirst, the guidelines say the questions should challenge the argument's validity without introducing new concepts. Let me look at the key claims here. Clinton mentions that most new jobs will come from small businesses. That's a specific claim. So, a useful question could challenge the basis of that claim. For example, asking what evidence supports that most jobs will come from small businesses. That's present in the text and challenges the validity.\n\nNext, she talks about investing in sectors like infrastructure, manufacturing, etc., to create jobs. But how do these investments directly lead to good jobs with rising incomes? The connection might be assumed, so questioning that link would be useful. It asks for the reasoning behind the claim without adding external ideas.\n\nThen, she mentions raising the minimum wage and equal pay to make the economy fairer. But making the economy fairer involves more than just these two policies. So, a question could ask if these measures alone are sufficient, addressing potential gaps in the argument. That stays within the text's content and challenges the sufficiency of the proposed solutions.\n\nI need to make sure these aren't unhelpful or invalid. The questions shouldn't be too broad or just ask for evidence without context. They should target specific parts of the argument. Let me check each one again. The first about small businesses is specific. The second about investments leading to jobs questions causality. The third about sufficiency of policies addresses the fairness claim. These all seem to fit the useful criteria without being too general or introducing new concepts."

He compares passengers wanting timely info with blaming airlines for quick resolutions. Is that a valid comparison? Maybe a question about that comparison would work. Also, he assumes that notifications lead to passengers delaying their trips and then missing flights. Does he provide evidence for that cause and effect? Another angle is his dismissal of passenger complaints as \"pouting.\" Does he consider that airlines might share responsibility?\n\nSo possible questions: 1.

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text about airline ticket discrimination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the text thoroughly. The main argument is that passengers shouldn't be discriminated against when bumped or compensated based on ticket price or using miles. The analogy is made to coffee prices, where regardless of cost, you get coffee. The author argues airlines shouldn't sell tickets if they can't fulfill them and that a ticket is a promise, not a lottery.\n\nNow, applying the guidelines. Each question must challenge the argument's validity by focusing on existing details without introducing new concepts. They should prompt reflection that could weaken the argument.\n\nLooking at the coffee analogy: The text says whether you pay $4 or $1, you get coffee. But airline tickets have variable factors like overbooking, which coffee shops don't. So a question could challenge if this analogy holds, pointing out differences in industry practices.\n\nNext, the claim that airlines shouldn't sell tickets if they can't afford to fulfill them. But airlines operate on overbooking models. A question here could ask if the assumption ignores standard practices that balance profitability and service, which might be necessary for their business model.\n\nThird, the text says passengers don't buy tickets to \"see if maybe\" they can get somewhere. But maybe some passengers do, like standby travelers. However, the text doesn't mention this. Wait, but the user said not to introduce new concepts. So instead, focus on the assumption that all passengers have the same expectations. Maybe not all tickets are equal in terms of flexibility. So a question could challenge if the assumption that every ticket purchase is a firm commitment overlooks different ticket types with varying conditions.\n\nCheck if these questions are specific, challenge the argument, and don't introduce external ideas. Avoid common sense or too broad questions. The coffee analogy question is good because it targets a core analogy. The second about business practices addresses a key point in the argument. The third about ticket types uses existing info about price/miles affecting service but questions the assumption of uniform expectations.\n\nAvoid unhelpful ones like \"Why is discrimination bad?\" which is too general. Also, not invalid questions that bring in new concepts like legal regulations unless mentioned. The text mentions price and miles, so focusing on that is safe.\n\nI think these three cover the necessary angles without stepping outside the text. Each makes the reader think about the validity of the author's comparisons and assumptions."

The main point seems to be Hillary's emphasis on her gender as a differentiating factor from Obama.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the questions challenge the argument's validity. The key here is that Hillary is using her gender as the main differentiator. So, I need to question the validity of that comparison.\n\nUseful questions should focus on details in the text without introducing new concepts. Let's look at the text again. Hillary responds to how she differs from Obama by stating \"As a woman it's clear\" and when pressed on policy differences, she again says, \"Hello, I'm a woman.\" The core argument is that gender alone is sufficient to differentiate her from Obama, without mentioning specific policies.\n\nSo, possible questions could challenge the assumption that gender alone is enough, ask about the relevance of gender without policy substance, or compare the emphasis on gender to other potential factors.\n\nAvoid questions that are too general or just ask for evidence. Also, no reading comprehension ones. For example, asking \"Why does Hillary mention being a woman?\" would be too obvious. Instead, dig deeper into the reasoning.\n\nFirst question: Maybe something about whether gender alone suffices as a differentiation without policy. Like, does the argument assume that gender inherently leads to different policies?\n\nSecond question: Maybe questioning if gender as a primary differentiator overshadows other aspects, like experience or policy.\n\nThird question: Could ask about the implications of equating gender with policy differences, does that bypass the need for substantive discussion.\n\nWait, need to check if those fit the guidelines. They should challenge the argument's validity by focusing on existing elements. Let me phrase them more precisely.\n\n1. Does the emphasis on gender as the primary differentiator from Obama sufficiently address substantive policy distinctions, or does it rely on an unproven assumption that gender inherently leads to differing approaches?\n\n2. How does the argument justify the prioritization of gender identity over specific policy positions when differentiating leadership roles, and what evidence supports this prioritization?\n\n3. If gender alone is presented as a clear differentiator, does this reasoning risk conflating identity with competency or policy substance, thereby weakening the argument's validity?\n\nHmm, maybe too wordy. Let's simplify while keeping the critical edge.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Does equating gender with policy differences adequately address the necessity for substantive distinctions in leadership, or does it assume inherent differences without evidence?\n\n2. How does the argument substantiate that gender alone is a sufficient differentiator without supporting policy-based examples?\n\n3. By focusing solely on gender, does the argument overlook the need to articulate concrete policy differences, thereby undermining its validity?\n\nYes, these questions challenge the validity by pointing out the reliance on gender without policy substance, which is present in the text. They don't introduce new concepts but focus on the existing argument's weaknesses."
