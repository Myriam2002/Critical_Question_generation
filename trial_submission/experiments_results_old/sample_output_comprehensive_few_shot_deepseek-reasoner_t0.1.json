The goal is to challenge the argument's validity by prompting reflection on existing points without introducing new concepts.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully. Clinton talks about building an economy for everyone, creating jobs in various sectors, raising the minimum wage, equal pay, and profit-sharing. The main claims are that these actions will create a fair economy with good jobs.\n\nNow, looking for potential weaknesses. She mentions that most new jobs will come from small businesses. Is there evidence supporting that? Also, raising the minimum wage and equal pay\u2014how do these directly lead to a fairer economy? And profit-sharing: does that actually contribute to fairness?\n\nFor the first question, challenging the assumption that small businesses are the primary job creators. Maybe there's data that contradicts this, so asking about evidence would make the reader question the validity.\n\nSecond, linking minimum wage and equal pay to a fairer economy. Are there factors that might negate these effects, like potential job losses from higher wages? The question should ask if these measures sufficiently address fairness or if there are other factors.\n\nThird, profit-sharing. The text says \"more companies do profit-sharing\" but doesn't explain how this ensures fairness. Maybe profit-sharing isn't equitable in practice. The question should challenge the assumption that profit-sharing inherently makes the economy fairer.\n\nNeed to ensure each question is specific to the text, doesn't introduce outside ideas, and targets the argument's validity.

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants three useful critical questions for Javier's argument about airline notifications.\n\nFirst, I need to understand Javier's main points. He's saying airlines should notify passengers of known delays within 30 minutes, but there are unavoidable problems. Airlines might not know how long issues like weather or maintenance will take. If they notify too early, passengers might delay going to the airport, but then the problem gets fixed faster than expected, leading to passengers missing their flight and blaming the airlines. He thinks flyers should take responsibility instead of blaming airlines.\n\nUseful questions need to challenge the argument's validity. Let me brainstorm:\n\n1. Javier assumes passengers will delay trips based on notifications. But is there evidence that enough passengers would actually do this to cause significant issues? Maybe most wouldn't change plans immediately, so the problem might be overstated.\n\n2. He claims airlines can't predict resolution times accurately. Is this always true? Maybe in some cases, airlines have data to estimate better, or perhaps there are ways to provide updates as situations evolve. The question could challenge the assumption that unpredictability is unavoidable.\n\n3. The argument blames passengers for wanting both timely notifications and flexibility. But is this a fair characterization? Maybe passengers just want accurate info, not both. The question could ask if the conflict Javier describes is real or based on an oversimplification.\n\nAlso, need to avoid unhelpful questions. For example, asking about consequences of the policy would be unhelpful if it supports the argument. Questions shouldn't introduce new concepts like specific regulations not mentioned.\n\nAnother angle: Javier uses examples like weather holds. Are those the main causes of delays, and does the argument overlook other factors where notifications are more feasible? That might challenge the validity by showing the argument focuses on exceptions.\n\nAlso, the comparison between passenger reactions and \"growing up.\" Does the argument dismiss valid concerns by attributing blame to passengers without considering systemic issues in airline communication?\n\nSo, possible questions:\n\n- Does Javier provide evidence that a significant number of passengers would delay their trips based on early notifications, leading to missed flights, or is this assumption speculative?\n- Is the inability of airlines to predict the resolution time for delays like weather holds absolute, or are there scenarios where more accurate estimations could be provided to passengers?\n- Does the argument conflate passengers' desire for timely notifications with an unrealistic expectation of perfect predictability, thereby oversimplifying the issue of shared responsibility?\n\nCheck if these fit the guidelines: they challenge specific points, use existing text details, and don't introduce new concepts. Yes, each addresses parts of Javier's argument, prompting reflection on assumptions and evidence."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate three useful critical questions for the given text. The text is about airline ticket discrimination, arguing that all passengers should be treated the same regardless of ticket price or miles used. The main points are comparing airline tickets to coffee cups, saying price shouldn't affect service, and that airlines shouldn't sell tickets they can't fulfill.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core arguments. The author equates airline tickets to coffee purchases, implying that regardless of price, the product (transportation) should be delivered as promised. They also argue that if airlines can't fulfill tickets at a certain price, they shouldn't sell them. So the key claims are: no discrimination based on ticket price/miles, tickets aren't lottery tickets, and airlines are responsible for fulfilling sold tickets.\n\nNow, to challenge these arguments, I need to find assumptions or weaknesses. For example, the coffee analogy: is buying an airline ticket the same as buying coffee? Maybe there are differences in service structures or terms of service that aren't considered. Also, the argument that airlines shouldn't sell tickets they can't afford\u2014do airlines have control over all factors affecting their ability to fulfill tickets, like weather or mechanical issues? Maybe they do, but maybe not. Also, the assertion that tickets aren't lottery tickets\u2014could there be elements of uncertainty in airline travel that the author is overlooking?\n\nPotential questions:\n\n1. **Does the coffee cup analogy accurately reflect the complexities of airline ticket sales and service fulfillment?** This challenges the validity of the comparison, which is central to the argument. If the analogy is flawed, the argument weakens.\n\n2. **How do airlines ensure that selling tickets at lower prices or through miles doesn't impact their ability to fulfill all reservations?** The text says they shouldn't sell if they can't afford it, but how is \"afford\" defined? This probes the feasibility of the claim.\n\n3. **What factors beyond the airline's control might prevent them from fulfilling a ticket, and how does that affect the argument against discrimination in bumping or compensation?** This questions the assumption that airlines have full control, introducing possible external factors.\n\nI need to check if these questions are useful per the guidelines. They target existing points without introducing new concepts. They don't ask for common sense answers or reading comprehension. Each question makes the reader reflect on the argument's validity. For example, the first question challenges the analogy's validity, which is a key part of the argument. The second questions the practicality of the airline's responsibility. The third brings up external factors that the author didn't consider, which could undermine the argument if those factors are significant.\n\nAvoiding unhelpful questions: For example, \"Why is discrimination wrong?\" would be too general. \"What are the consequences of not compensating fairly?\" might support the argument instead of weakening it. Also, avoiding invalid questions that aren't tied to the text, like asking about train travel if the text only discusses airlines.\n\nYes, the three questions I listed fit the criteria. They each target specific parts of the argument, prompting critical evaluation without introducing external ideas."
