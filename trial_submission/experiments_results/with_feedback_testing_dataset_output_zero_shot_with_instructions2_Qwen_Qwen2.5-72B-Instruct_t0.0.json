My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.\nI am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.\nIf I eat a peanut I'll get sick.\nI ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.\nIt was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.\nI would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.\nEverybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.\"\"",

By asking for evidence, the question prompts the reader to consider whether Clinton's policies are based on empirical research, expert opinions, or other forms of credible evidence, which is essential for evaluating the validity of her argument.

The unpredictability of peanut allergy reactions and the limitations of emergency measures like EpiPens are central to the claim that peanut allergy is a disability, especially in the context of air travel. By exploring how the unpredictability of reactions affects the feasibility of relying on EpiPens, the question encourages critical analysis of the argument's underlying assumptions and the potential risks associated with air travel for individuals with severe peanut allergies. This line of inquiry can help evaluate the validity of the argument that peanut allergy constitutes a disability, particularly in situations where emergency medical help may be delayed, such as during flights.",
