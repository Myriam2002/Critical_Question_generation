        "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to come up with critical questions for Hillary Clinton's argument here. Let's start by understanding her main points. She's talking about building an economy that works for everyone, creating jobs in various sectors, raising the minimum wage, equal pay for women, and profit-sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to challenge the validity of these arguments. Let's see. She mentions investing in infrastructure, manufacturing, etc. But how does she plan to ensure these jobs are \"good jobs with rising incomes\"? Maybe the question could ask about the mechanisms to ensure job quality.\n\nThen, she says most new jobs come from small businesses. Is there evidence that small businesses can generate enough jobs to meet the demand? Maybe that's a point to question.\n\nRaising the minimum wage and equal pay are mentioned. But would raising the minimum wage lead to unintended consequences like reduced hiring? That's a common critique, so a question here could challenge the assumption that raising wages won't have negative effects.\n\nProfit-sharing is another point. How would she incentivize companies to adopt profit-sharing without harming their competitiveness? That's a potential question.\n\nAlso, when she talks about investing in the future, what specific policies ensure that investments reach everyone and not just certain groups? Maybe that's a way to question the fairness aspect.\n\nI need to make sure the questions don't introduce new concepts. For example, asking about automation's impact might be external if she didn't mention it. Avoid that.\n\nSo, possible questions:\n\n1. How will the proposed investments in infrastructure and technology specifically ensure that new jobs are accessible to individuals across different skill levels and regions?\n\n2. What evidence supports the claim that small businesses will generate most new jobs, given potential challenges like access to capital and market competition?\n\n3. How does raising the minimum wage address potential unintended consequences such as reduced employment opportunities for entry-level workers?\n\n4. What mechanisms would enforce equal pay for women's work and hold companies accountable for existing wage disparities?\n\n5. How would profit-sharing initiatives be structured to ensure they benefit employees without compromising a company's ability to reinvest in growth and innovation?\n\nEach of these questions targets specific parts of her argument without bringing in external factors. They challenge the feasibility, evidence, and potential gaps in her proposals."

        "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to generate critical questions for Javier's argument about airline delay notifications. Let me start by understanding his main points. He says airlines should notify passengers of known delays within 30 minutes, but he's concerned that unpredictable issues like weather or maintenance can resolve faster than expected. If passengers delay going to the airport based on the initial notice, they might miss their flight if it departs earlier than now expected. He argues that flyers shouldn't blame airlines for such situations and need to take responsibility.\n\nNow, I need to challenge his argument's validity. The guidelines say the questions should focus on existing details, not introduce new concepts. Let's see. Javier assumes that airlines can't predict when issues will resolve. A good question might ask if he's considered that airlines could provide real-time updates instead of a single notification, which would address the problem of changing timelines. That's present in the text because he mentions the uncertainty in resolution times. \n\nAnother angle: Javier claims passengers can't have it both ways, but maybe the question could challenge whether the responsibility is solely on passengers. For example, asking if there's a shared responsibility between airlines and passengers to communicate updates more effectively. Wait, but does the text mention shared responsibility? Javier says flyers need to grow up, so the text implies it's the passengers' fault. The question should challenge that assumption without bringing in new ideas. Maybe ask if he's considered that airlines' inconsistent updates contribute to passenger frustration. That's in the text because he mentions flyers getting upset when flights leave early.\n\nAlso, Javier uses \"many times\" the issues resolve faster. A question could ask if this frequency is documented or just anecdotal. That challenges the evidence behind his claim. But does the text provide any data? He says \"many times\" based on his experience as a frequent traveler. So the question could ask if his personal experience is sufficient to generalize, which is a valid challenge.\n\nAnother point: he says airlines can't know exactly when issues will be fixed. A question might ask whether airlines have processes to estimate and communicate revised timelines, which they might not be using effectively. That's within the text's scope because he's talking about their inability to know exact times.\n\nI should avoid questions that are too general, like \"Are delays always the airline's fault?\" That's not specific enough. Also, avoid introducing concepts like government regulations if Javier didn't mention them.\n\nSo, possible questions:\n\n1. Does the assumption that airlines cannot improve their prediction methods for resolving delays overlook potential advancements in real-time communication technology? (This challenges his premise that airlines can't know exact times by suggesting possible solutions within existing tech.)\n\n2. How does the argument account for passengers who rely on timely updates to make informed decisions without alternative travel options? (This questions the fairness of blaming passengers when they might not have flexibility.)\n\n3. Is there evidence that the frequency of flights departing sooner than expected is significant enough to justify shifting responsibility entirely onto passengers? (Challenges the basis of his claim by questioning the prevalence of the issue.)\n\n4. Could the airlines' current communication practices contribute to passenger frustration even when delays are resolved quickly? (Focuses on existing communication issues mentioned in the text.)\n\n5. Does the argument conflate the responsibility of providing accurate updates with the impossibility of perfect predictability, thereby absolving airlines of improving their communication protocols? (Challenges the dichotomy he presents between knowing delays and unpredictable resolutions.)\n\nEach of these questions targets Javier's assumptions or the evidence he uses, without introducing external ideas. They make the reader reflect on gaps in his reasoning."

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate critical questions based on the given text. The text argues against airlines discriminating compensation when bumping passengers based on ticket price or miles used. The author compares airline tickets to coffee, saying price shouldn't affect whether you get the product.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main arguments. The key points are: 1) Airlines shouldn't discriminate in bumping/compensation based on ticket cost or miles. 2) Tickets aren't lotteries; purchasing a ticket is a promise to transport. 3) Airlines set prices, so if they can't afford to honor a ticket, they shouldn't sell it. 4) The price paid shouldn't mean uncertainty in service.\n\nNow, I need to create questions that challenge these points. The guidelines say the questions should focus on existing details, not introduce new concepts. They should make the reader reflect to weaken the argument's validity.\n\nLooking at the coffee analogy: \"Same as if one pays $4 for a cup of coffee or $1, the cup is supposed to have coffee in it.\" A question here could challenge if the analogy is valid. Airlines might have different operational challenges than a coffee shop. So, how does that affect the argument?\n\nAnother point is the airline's responsibility in pricing. The text says if they can't afford to give a ticket at a price, they shouldn't sell it. But maybe there's an assumption here that airlines can perfectly predict overbooking. Is overbooking a standard practice that complicates this? So a question could ask about the assumption that airlines can accurately predict no-shows.\n\nAlso, the text says passengers don't buy tickets hoping to maybe reach a destination. But in reality, do passengers understand that overbooking is a possibility? Maybe some terms and conditions mention this, so the question could address whether passengers are informed about the risks, thus affecting their expectations.\n\nWhat about the comparison between tangible products (coffee) and services (flights)? Services have more variables. So, does the analogy hold when considering the nature of the service versus a physical product?\n\nAnother angle: the argument states that price shouldn't dictate maybe getting the service. But in other industries, like event tickets, higher prices might offer better guarantees (e.g., refund policies). Is there a precedent where price affects service guarantees, making the airline's practice more acceptable?\n\nAlso, the text assumes that all ticket purchases are equal in their commitment from the airline. But maybe frequent flyer miles tickets have different terms. Does the airline's contract differentiate, and if so, does that justify different treatment?\n\nWait, but the user said to avoid introducing new concepts. So I need to make sure the questions don't bring in external ideas but focus on what's in the text. For example, the coffee analogy is in the text, so a question about its validity is okay. Similarly, the airline's pricing and their ability to afford tickets are in the text.\n\nPossible questions:\n\n1. How does the comparison between airline tickets and coffee cups account for the logistical complexities and variables inherent in air travel that don't apply to serving a simple beverage?\n\nThis challenges the analogy by pointing out differences in complexity.\n\n2. What evidence supports the assumption that airlines can accurately predict and control circumstances to avoid overbooking when setting ticket prices?\n\nThis questions the feasibility of the claim that airlines shouldn't sell tickets they can't afford to honor, considering overbooking is common.\n\n3. If passengers are aware of the possibility of being bumped when purchasing a ticket, does this knowledge alter the expectation that the ticket guarantees transportation as implied by the coffee cup analogy?\n\nThis addresses whether passenger awareness affects the argument's validity, based on the text's assumption that tickets aren't like lotteries.\n\n4. Does the argument consider that airlines might have contractual terms allowing them to bump passengers, which could legally justify different compensation based on ticket type?\n\nThis refers to the text's mention of frequent flyer miles and ticket prices, questioning if existing terms might justify the discrimination.\n\nBut I need to ensure these don't introduce new concepts. The text mentions frequent flyer miles and compensation, so question 4 is okay. The coffee analogy is in the text, so question 1 is valid. The overbooking aspect is implied in the argument's context, even if not explicitly stated, but the text does talk about bumping passengers. So maybe it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, the text says \"the airline decides what prices or miles are used to purchase a promise to get you from A to B.\" So a question could challenge whether the terms of that \"promise\" include conditions about bumping, which would affect the argument's validity.\n\nHmm. The goal is to make the reader reflect on the text's weaknesses. So each question should target a specific part of the argument and expose a potential flaw without bringing in external info."
