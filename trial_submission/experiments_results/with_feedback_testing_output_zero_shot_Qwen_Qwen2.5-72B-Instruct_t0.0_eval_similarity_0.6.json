The question does not challenge any argument in the text or prompt a deeper analysis of Clinton's claim. Additionally, the text does not provide enough information to answer this question, and the question might be too complex to be practical. \n\nA more useful question might be one that challenges Clinton's assumption about the relationship between corporate tax rates and repatriation, or one that asks for evidence to support Clinton's claim that she supports the repatriation of money stranded overseas.",

My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.\nI am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.\nIf I eat a peanut I'll get sick.\nI ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.\nIt was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.\nI would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.\nEverybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.\"\"",

The argument presented is based on the assumption that airborne particles from peanuts pose a significant and life-threatening risk to the child. By asking about the commonality of such reactions, the question encourages critical evaluation of the severity of the risk and whether it constitutes a disability. This is a crucial aspect of the argument, as it directly impacts the conclusion that the child's condition is a disability that could limit their future opportunities. Understanding the frequency and severity of such reactions can help assess the validity of the argument and the extent to which the child's allergy might indeed pose a significant risk in various situations, such as air travel.",
