My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.\nI am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.\nIf I eat a peanut I'll get sick.\nI ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.\nIt was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.\nI would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.\nEverybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.\"\"",

The speaker's argument is based on the idea that these individuals are contributing members of society (\"they work\") and therefore deserve certain benefits (in this case, healthcare coverage). By asking what it means to be a part of this society, the question encourages critical thinking about the criteria for membership and the implications of this membership. It also invites consideration of the potential boundaries and qualifications for being considered a part of the society, which is a crucial aspect of the argument. \n\nThis question is not simply a matter of reading comprehension, nor is it too complex or vague. It directly addresses the underlying premise of the speaker's argument and requires a thoughtful examination of the concept of societal membership, making it a useful question for critical analysis.",

The text mentions the goal of achieving debt-free college and affordable child care, but it does not provide a detailed plan for how to achieve these goals. Asking for such a plan may be seen as a request for additional information rather than a critical analysis of the argument presented. Additionally, the answer to this question may require a significant amount of information and context that is not provided in the text, making it impractical for critical analysis. \n\nA more useful question might be: \"How does Clinton's proposal to have the wealthy pay their fair share and close corporate loopholes relate to achieving debt-free college and affordable child care?\" or \"What assumptions underlie Clinton's claim that debt-free college and affordable child care can be achieved through her proposed methods?\" These questions would allow for a more critical analysis of the argument presented in the text.",

The question requires Clinton to provide a clear definition of what constitutes \"fair share\" and how she plans to enforce the closure of corporate loopholes, which is a crucial aspect of her proposal.
